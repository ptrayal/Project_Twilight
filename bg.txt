The Gangrel were the most powerful and most numerous clan in the city,
mostly due to the fact that if you included the Prince, almost half the
gangrel were of the Prince's bloodline.  (Note: No Player may start of the
McLir bloodline)

Fang - An outcast amongst the Gangrel, he wanted little to do with
McLir.  More an Anarch than anything else, he often went into the wilderness
and came back more angry.  

Janice Weaver - One of the Ancillae in the city, she was not of the
McLir blood line, but was often a challenger to him.  She was the voice of
compassion and wisdom in the clan, where McLir often wanted action.  

Logan Reeves - Logan was a Gangrel who had a deadly past-time, he hunted
werewolves and thus was openly disliked by Fang and Janice Weaver and
enjoyed the favor of McLir.  

Private Hudson - Private Hudson spoke little and preferred action.  A
former veteran of the Vietnam war, he often thought he was still there.  

McLir - Prince McLir, if he had a name, rarely used it.  He spoke in a
decidedly Celtic accent and was a fair prince.  He tolerated the anarchs,
upheld the Traditions, and hated the Sababt and Werewolves.  His children or
grandchildren include: Fizzy Fitzgerald, Marigold, and Nikola Sleat.  

Fizzy Fitzgerald - The grandchilde of McLir and Childe of Marigold, he
was often viewed as a disappointment by McLir.  Embraced for who knows what
reason, he was not often in court.  

Marigold - Even Kindred embrace for love and that is what Marigold was. 
For whatever reason, Marigold was the love of McLir and thus highly
protected.  She was vicious in combat on her own and moved with amazing
speed when she needed too.  

Nikola Sleat - The practical embrace of the Prince was Nikola.  A former
police-office, he helped with the security for the city and was often at
odd's with the Sheriff - Gideon Darkly.  An odd man, he had some unusual
quirks, such as always walking in steps of three.

The Ventrue were a fractured, back-bitting lot and thus wielded little

often the outcasts in a city ruled by the Gangrel.

David Stirling - A quiet Ventrue, he was Rich, but that was about
it.  He was also somewhat deformed and something of an outcast amongst
his own clan.

Donovan Tobias - Donovan was the Ventrue who wanted to be in charge
and wasn't.  He often fought with Madeline Carper for control of the
clan.  He was making in-roads before the disappearances.

Madeline Carper - A powerful business woman turned Kindred, she was
the Primogen of Clan Ventrue, though she did not rule her clan.  Two of
her clanmates could care less about politics and the other fought her
constantly, so her job was a tough one.

Nicholas Devereaux - A large man known for his disgusting ability to
eat food, he could care less about Kindred politics.  Indeed, he rarely
got involved except to finance things.

Regent.  The face of the clan was reasonably well-liked, though feared,

voice of reason in the Primogen Council.

Marcus Lucas - One of the newest to the city, little was known to
the outside world about Marcus.

Sabitina Delestrego - An attractive young Tremere, Sabitina was also
a potent thaumaturgist. While not the most powerful in the clan, she was
almost always at the Regent's side.

Valentino Drak - The thug of Clan Tremere was Valentino.  Few who
saw him in action doubted that. He was fond of flame and used it
frequently, a little too frequently for the Regent who disciplined him
at least once for his indescretions.

The Nosferatu were a surprisingly small clan in the city.  While not

city was a Nosferatu.

Ava Porter - Ava Porter was a new Nosferatu to the city, but was an
up-and-comer.  Little was known of her though.

Mihail - If you wanted information, he was your person.  Mihail
would trade information and favors with anyone for almost anything.  He
was completely repugnant, but he was the Nosferatu front-man for
information trading.  He was also their Primogen.

Peter Martingale - Peter was blind.  He was also the son of a
powerful Nosferatu in Europe.  Despite all this, he was not terribly
well-liked.  He did however have a beautiful voice, which endeared him
to the Toreador in the city.

Dr. Tench - One of the elders of the City, there was little Tench
did not have his fingers in. Rumored to be literally involved in every
mortal affair that went on in the city, there was almost nothing he
could not accomplish in the mortal world.  He was a sometime ally of
Prince McLir and if rumors were true, a thaumaturgist as well.

Morriganna - The only known childe of Tench, she was incredibly new,
still in her accounting period.  Rumored to be embraced because she was
a medium, few bothered her for fear of Tench's retailation.

Louis Zola - The second in command of the Clan, he had his hands in
everything.  Indeed, he had managed to become a Harpy in the city.  Many
believed it was because it was the Prince's way of keeping an eye on
him.

Osa - Osa was the youngest age wise of the clan, but everyone knew
it was because Old Monster called in a favor and embraced her.  No one
is really sure why though and she remained out of sight except when Old
Monster made an appearance.

he helped keep the Malkavians under control, which the Prince
appreciated.  Oddly enough, the Ventrue did often invite him to events.

The City had been ruled by Camarilla Kindred since it's inception. 
Originally, the city was 'colonized' by three elders McLir, Amon ak Tul, and
Dr.  Tench.  They setup the city, and with the exception of McLir, retired
from active Kindred politics.  McLir became the Prince of the City and ruled
under Camarilla law.  

McLir was served by a Primogen Council, two harpies, and a sheriff.  The
city's financial resources were 'managed' by the Giovanni, with assistance
from Dr.  Tench.  In essence, the city was ruled by the Elders and then the
Ancillae.  Every other Kindred in the city was a neonate, and many would
say, a pawn of the Elders.  

The Elders also drove out the Werewolves from the area a long time ago and
no one has seen hide nor hair of them since.
