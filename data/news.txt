IMPORTANT PEOPLE GO MISSING

In the past week, several important people have disappeared, including,
but not limited to the Mayor, several alderman, and a few other
important persons.  This has local police and the FBI baffled.  Many are
speculating there is a probe into possible corruption involved and that
is why so many have gone missing.
 
If you have any information on this, please contact your local FBI agent.
