Dr. Greenthumb~
Dr. Greenthumb stands here waiting patiently for something.~
This man, identified by the nametag on his white lab coat - doesn't look
too professional for some reason.  Maybe it's the Timberlands he's wearing
on his feet - or maybe it's the loose Ruff Ryder jeans that hang down low on
his hips showing his plaid boxers.  Whatever it is, he claims to be a doctor
- what could he be selling?

Welcome to Project Twilight, also affectionately called: PT.  This school
has been designed preferably for newbies - so if this doesn't apply to you
feel free to enter the game at any time.  This place is one of the few
actual RP MUD's that is more on the side of RP than hack and slash, so it
makes sense to cover RP commands first.

Since role playing is an essential part of PT there of course are many
commands based around it to give a much more wholesome environment.  Here
are some of them now that you can feel free to try out on your own.  To
begin role playing you must list yourself on the role playing list with
'rpavail topic' where topic is what theme you want to rp in.  'rpwho', and
'whorp' lists who is currently active on that list.  To get to anyone on
that list simply type 'rpjoin name', and of course don't forget to insert
yourself into 'rpmode' so that the necessities of food and water don't
interfere with your game play.  Note: Try looking at the highlighted words
to see a further description.

E
malkavian~
Topic:  Clan Malkavian, "The Kooks" Description:The childer of Malkav bear two curses: undeath and madness.  Fromemotionless sociopaths to raving lunatics and everything in between, theemotionless sociopaths to raving lunatics and everything in between, theMalkavians nonetheless command startling insight.  Does what they knowdrive them to madness or does their insanity allow them too peer into aworld the rest of us fear to see?  Even other Damned fear theMalkavians. The cursed blood of their clan has polluted their minds, with the resultthat every last Malkavian across the world is incurably insane.  What'sworse, a Malkavian's madness can take nearly any form, from overpoweringhomicidal tendencies to near-catatonia.  In many cases, there's no wayto tell a Malkavian apart from the "sane" members of other clans.  Thosefew whose psychoses are immediately obvious are among the mostterrifying vampires to stalk the streets.~
E
nosferatu~

Up from the storm drains andtunnels they scuttle, but whether as ally or foe remains to be seen.~
E
toreador~
Topic:  Clan Toreador Description:More than just a simple clan of artists, the Toreador helped found theCamarilla and have extensive dealings with the mortal world.  More thanany other Kindred, they feel the damnation of the Embrace, as itextinguishes the flame of creativity for which they long.  But whatpassions inspire the Toreador after they receive the Embrace?  TheToreador are called many things - "degenerates," "artistes," "poseurs"and "hedonists" being but a few.  But any such lumpen categorizationdoes the clan a disservice. Depending on the individual and her mood, Toreador are alternatelyelegant and flamboyant, brilliant and ludicrous, visionary anddissipated.  Perhaps the only truism that can be applied to the clan isits members' aesthetic zeal.  Whatever a Toreador does, she does withpassion.  Whatever a Toreador is, she is with passion.~
E
ventrue~
Topic:  Clan Ventrue, "The Bluebloods" Description:Capitalists, aristocrats, crusaders and criminals: The Ventrue haveassumed the prestigious but demanding role of leaders.  Forever in theline of fire, they have sacrificed their own comfort for the good of allKindred.  Or is this all a facade that hides their excesses and greed?The Kindred of Clan Ventrue have a reputation for being honorable,genteel and of impeccable taste.  From time out of mind, Ventrue hasbeen the clan of leadership, enforcing the ancient traditions andseeking to shape the destiny of the Kindred.  In nights of old, Ventruewere chosen from nobles, merchant princes or other wielders of power. In modern times the clan recruits from wealthy "old money" families,ruthless corporate climbers, and politicians.  Whatever their origin,Ventrue vampires preserve stability and maintain order for theCamarilla.  Other Kindred often mistake this for arrogance or avarice,but to the Ventrue, their shepherd's role is more burden than honor.~
