Stan~
Stan stands here glaring into the monitors as if watching for something.
~
Stan looks to be a middle aged man complete with thinning hair line and
fancy Italian suit.  The hair he does have left is brown and his also dark
brown eyes make for a very average appearance.  Mumbling to himself almost
constantly it seems as if he's holding a conversation with himself.

A small silver key is here.~
This small key looks as if it fits into a padlock but the grooves seem to
indicate it fits into a door lock of some type.  The word west has been
engraved into it.

Entry of the "Arc Lamp" Nightclub~
The party never seems to sleep here, always loud, always happening, the
"Arc Lamp" rocks on.  Somehow the club always has music, often good, and
always fun to dance to.  The entrance is manned by two very large men who
look like they could easily keep the peace by force.

The Arc Lamp~
A blast of hard rock music and laughing voices pound against the walls
like an anvil.  The smell of sweat and alcohol fills the air.  A dance floor
packed shoulder to shoulder with young, gothic people can be seen to the
south while a blood streaked fountain lies to the west.

On the Dance Floor~
Young men and women are here drinking and carrying on making it hard to
move around.  The "dance floor", as it's called, seems to be more of crowded
mingling area.  A few more extreme people are a little closer to the stage
south of here trying to start their own mosh pit.  There appears to be a bar
to the west and an empty hall to the east.

At the Bar~
A long black marble bar is here bristling with people ordering drinks and
chatting with each other.  A large mirror behind the bar is almost covered
by multiple shelves of various liquors.  The dance floor can be seen to the
east from here.

A Back Hallway~
This short hallway dead ends with a door to the north marked "Men" and
one to the south marked "Women".  The wall to the east seems to have been
forgotten in the decorating as the plain drywall shows through.  A large
gathering of people can be seen dancing just to the west from here.

Inside the Mens Bathroom~
Covered with mildew, urine stains, and years of dust rust and corrosion
this is almost the nastiest place imaginable.  The sink, long lost of it's
mirror, sits here clogged with who knows what while green algae builds it's
home in the water.  The toilet has leaks all in the tank, and the seat seems
to have been removed long ago.  Think you can hold it a little while longer?

On Stage~
Curtains cover the walls and a low ceiling hides the lack of investment
put into this place to transform it from a storage building into a party
house.  Oversized speakers cover the entire rear of the stage leaving little
room up front for a small band of rockers to perform live for the gathering
mass of mostly teens and young adults.  Some type of dance floor can be seen
to the north.

The Storage Room~
This large storage area is filled with crates of all types of bar food as
well as a wide assortment of kegs of some very old beer.  Some crates in the
corner seem to be stacked in a way so that one could climb them up through
the ceiling.

At the Top of the Crates~
These crates seem sturdy enough to hold a lot of weight.  It's almost as
if they're left here to be climbed up and down.  There is some sort of
office to the east while a storage room is down from here.

The Office in the Arc Lamp~
In a sudden change of surroundings this office seems as if it belongs in
a large office building instead of on the second floor of a nightclub.  A
single large oak desk sits in the center of the room and has papers and
files stacked here and there on it.  A small lap top computer sits in the
middle plugged in through a small hole near the front of the desk.  Monitors
cover the northern wall and show at least two different angles to every room
in the club downstairs.  The only exit is to the west.
