Welcome to the RPG Cinema~
Bright white tiles cover the floor here, and a long red carpet covers the
tiles down the center of the room making it seem as if everyone is a VIP
guest.  Bright lights flow from the west in this shaded area, where only
small circular lights placed strategically throughout the room makes it
possible to see.  A small glass booth with a hole in the front sits next to
the locked front doors.  A myriad of pictures hang under a soft glow of
halogen lamps advertising movies to come and movies currently showing, and
the times they are playing.  The mall continues west while the theater
continues south.

The Concession Stand~
Stepping through the dark mahogany doors leads into an oddly lit room. 
Not a single conventional light is in this entire room save the actual booth
that sells the popcorn and other odd assortment of candies and drinks.  The
rest of the room is covered from walls to ceiling with a mirror-like surface
and strangely designed neon lights flash here and there.  The same brightred
carpet leads to the next set of doors to the south or through the one-way
doors that lead back into the mall to the west.

A Sparsely-Lit Movie Theater~
Darkness, only cut by the lights running down the main aisle in the
center of the room leading to the plush red velvet seats waiting for
something to be spilled on them.  The soft glow of the projector in the back
of the room also helps illuminate the area slightly as the hunt for the open
seat begins.  There is only a main exit north of here leading to the
Concession Stand.

Inside a Parking Lot~
The back of the parking lot here has a few abandoned vehicles with rotted
tires, flaking paint, busted windows and graffiti all over their sides.  One
wonders why they never get towed away like all the signs mention up front? 
The parking lot continues west while the mall begins to the north.

Food Court - a Hotdog stand~
This area of the food court is well-lit and looks to be freshly painted. 
The tiles, one can tell, have recently been repaired and scrubbed clean. 
The food court continues to the east and south.

Entrance to a Parking Lot~
This is where the asphalt ends and the cement parking lot begins.  The
parking lot leads down about a foot from the main road with a slight hump in
the road here and there to keep speeders to a minimum.  Bright yellow lines
mark the oversized parking spaces out for the shoppers, and bright blue
lines for the handicapped fill the front spaces out.  The main road is to
the west of here while the parking lot continues to the east.

Food Court - Under Rennovation~
This area of the food court looks like it is under construction.  There
is fresh paint on the walls and the tiles have been scrubbed clean.  It
looks like this area is being rennovated for new shops.  The food court
continues to the west and south.

Inside a Parking Lot~
Bright yellow lines continue in a well thought out pattern across the
sides of the parking lot with systematically placed cross walks for
pedestrians to cross safely into the mall just to the north of here. 
Brightly painted walls and signs attract the eye away from the parking lot
and encourage the mind to spend, spend, spend!  The parking lot continues
east and west.

Inside a Fitting Room~
This rather plain fitting room has a few spare hangers lying around inthe corner and a mirror on each wall, the most important feature though isprivacy.  The door goes all the way to the floor and no sign of cameraspeaking over the edge of the wall or anywhere else in the fitting room forthat manner.  To the north lies the main store.  ~
