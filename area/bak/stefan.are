Outside the Rodon~
You are now standing in front of a two floor neoclassical building, that
seems to have been made sometime in the twentieth century and closer to its
beginning.  It is well preserved though, stone and wood blending to create
an impression of regality and status, and a number of well placed tall,
narrow windows can shed ample light to the inner areas during the day.  The
entrance to the Rodon - marked as such only by a discreet, finely forged
bronze sign painted in red hanging over it - is attended at all times by
formally dressed men in butler's suits and wide-brimmed hats.  The pavements
are cleaned regularly to preserve the immaculate overall image of the
building, and cars are not allowed to park directly outside it, kept away by
posts and silvery chains.

The Reception Area~
First impressions being what they are, the Rodon wastes little time or
space to that effect; first a red strip of thick persian carpet ushering
visitors in towards the inner chambers of the building, while on both sides,
there are two artificial rose gardens, each arranged with great care for
detail and lighting, a reflection of the other but very much different. 
Each of the flowers in the garden's left side are made of metal, each a
different one; bronze and silver, iron and steel, lead and platinum and
copper, they all seem to be in different shades of dark colours, all turning
away instead of turning towards a small sun-like orb made of gold which
casts a pale, steady fluorescent illumination from above.  It is the
impression of sunlight that sends the flowers into an ash shaded,
metallically rigid desolation that this setting brings to mind.  On the
right side, a reflection of the last rose garden exists; but this time only
a series of internal, carefully concealed and expertly placed tiny sources
glow to shed colorful rays into a multitude of crystalline flowers that have
been hand-crafted in even the most miniscule details of their petals,
participating in a joyous celebration of bright, fitting combination of
colours unlike their image across the hallway.  Under the nocturnal
celebration the roses are flourishing into a prosperous bloom of vivid
colouration.

The Rodon's Main Hall~
Very rare are the times, in all hours of the day or night, that the main
chamber that serves as the Rodon's central hall is anywhere near empty;
there are well-dressed uniformed servants and maids constantly moving about
to offer refreshments, pick up leftover glasses or attend to the various
visitors that frequent the building.  It is hard to not notice the
highly-placed narrow windows that during the day will provide plentiful
light on the inside; each of them is fit with coloured glass that provides
different shades as the daylight's direction changes, a matter which must
have taken some planning by an experienced designer in the process.  Several
stalls, coffee tables and leather armchairs offer positions of rest and
opportunities to bask in the surroundings and hold conversations.  It is

A Wide Balcony~
From here, some small part of the city and its harbor can be seen, the
waters stirred only by the occasional ship that comes to deliver a cargo or
is sent out for one; there are a very few smaller boats, sometimes yachts
and private vessels enjoying the reverse view that you are, at this moment. 
The street below, central enough to be frequented at all times of the day
and night, is a living thing.  You can see men and women from high above -
each floor of the Rodon's neoclassic building is taller than modern
architecture seems to want them - and they come from all paths of life; from
the hurried walk of an expensive suit rushing for an appointment, to the
slow stroll of couples out for some shopping, to the uncertain gait of drug
addicts and homeless folks looking for a place to spend the night.  It all
seems to be so far from here.  The balcony sports three long tables and
bamboo armchairs with comfortable pillows to allow for some time to be spent
in leisure and relaxation, and there are soft lights above that can be
dimmed to allow for more private sessions.

The ball room of the Rodon~
Perhaps so that no one will sit alone in a corner, the Rodon's ball room
has none; shaped to be full circular, with several white and inobtrusive
lights on its high-ceiling casting plentiful illumination and speakers built
into the wooden walls in strategic positions in order to provide the best
results, there is nothing else in the hall that can stand in the way of
dancers.  The floor to the room is perhaps its most distrinctive feature;
old dark wood oak that will squeek softly when stepped upon, made of long
tiles that have been painted and polished until they are literally
reflecting back the images of things and people above them.  The walls
themselves are much different, and yet they blend with the room as a whole
and are evidence of the degree of attention to the detail that has been put
in; made of stripes of painted wood that together depict the scenery of an
ancient, lively forest, there are eyes hidden among those bushes and
creatures blending in with the green, providing dancers with the illusion
that they are celebrating under an old star-lit sky in the kind of woods
that once were, and never will be again.

A conference room~
The way this amphitheatrical room's acoustics are designed, a word spoken
from the raised podium will carry well even to the furthest seats or someone
standing by the door without great need for technological enhancements; but
those do exist, as the eye for detail will notice the long series of small
speakers placed up at somewhat elevated positions on each wall to lend those
who employ them an impression of authority.  Except for the podium itself,
the rest of the hall is less brightly lit as to focus the audience's
attention on to the speakers more than each other.  There are tiny red
lights built into the wide, comfortable corridors between each row of seats
to allow for easy passage, and provisions have for brand-new looking leather
chairs that must have quite pricely only by themselves.
