Stan Widorski stands here eyeing people as they come and go.

Widorski stands here around four feet even, and that's with his shoes
that add three inches because of the cushioned soles.  Wearing an outfit
that would give a heart attack to any fashion conscious minded person, he
stands behind his counter reliving a memory from his hip days in the
sixties.  Has he ever told you the one about ....

A small, white mushroom is growing here.~

edges of the milky white substance of the sulfur water.  It looks slightly
smaller than an average white mushroom but that may be because of what it
was using for nutrients is slightly different.

Second Street~
Here Second Street runs through a dirty, dilapidated part of town.  The
windows of several buildings are broken and covered with cardboard and duct
tape.  There is trash on the streets and an odd smell fills the nostrils. 
In a window to the east, there is a half-lit neon sign, which reads
"Widorski's Gun and Pawn, We Buy Your Crap".

Widorski's Gun and Pawn~
Entering the shop is like entering a time warp.  Old clothing and jewelry
from years now gone line the shelves.  Old eight track tapes sit piled over
in one corner and vinyl records sit in a large crate in another - all
equally stacked in dust.  Guns line the walls behind the counter full of
jewelry.  A few sets of someones pre-owned, polished aluminum rims line up
across the floor waiting for someone to trip over theme.

Second Street~
The people that live in the rundown part of town must seem rich to the
people that live here in this almost forgotten corner of the city.  This
small street is so narrow two cars could barely fit through it if they were
to run one wheel almost into the ditch.  From here the street appears to be
one-way although one couldn't be sure unless you follow it down.

The Sinkhole Under Widorsky's Place~
Sparse light filters down through the old wood floor from above and the
hole left open the rims upstairs were covering, but not enough to completely
see by.  The smell of sulfur water permeates the air very strongly, but
nothing that would kill anyone - quickly that is.  It seems this sink hole
has been in the works for many years as it goes down maybe another five
yards below the rock cleft you're on.  There also seems to be a ledge almost
wide enough to walk on to the west from here.

No way back up to the surface can be seenalong the slimy surface of the walls, might as well make do and follow thewater to the west from here.  Maybe somewhere along the way there'll be away up or out.  ~

The Bottom of the Sinkhole~
Still trudging along the knee-deep water, the cavern itself seems to begetting shorter and shorter almost to the point that one would have to bebent over at the waist to get through.  At this point the water looks rathermilky and stagnant, definitely not drinkable.  A new smell, if it'spossible, seems to be coming from somewhere to the west of here.  ~

The white milky substance hardens even more here making it mostly easy towalk on, but if one were to stand too long in one place it'd be like walkingin quicksand.  Oddly enough it looks as if there was once a dog runningaround in here at one point in time as a few paw prints sit here trapped inthe thick oozing sludge.  To the east the cavern seems to get taller, aswell as much brighter, while to the south is too dark to tell.  ~

here allowing one to travel up, while there seems to be a limestone cavern
to the west from here.

Standing on a ladder, just under a flood drain, one can see out onto what
appears to be third street just up above.  The faint smell of sulfur can be
smelled coming from somewhere below.  The almost ancient looking brick walls
seem to be a little strained having an occupant on the severely rusted
ladder that leads down to the drain floor as well as up to a street.
