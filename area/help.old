~
Desc SOCEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.
SOCEDIT DELETE [social] deletes that social. The deletion is
irrecoverable, save for restoring a backup file, so use this command
with great care!
SOCEDIT NEW [social] creates a new, empty social. SOCEDIT SHOW [social]
shows all of the strings for that social.
SOCEDIT [string-name] [social] [string] changes a certain of the 7
strings that make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message
will be sent to the involved characters.
There are 7 strings that make up a social:
cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and
sees:
Hug whom?
onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the
case of HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player
types HUG by itself.
cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:
You hug Y.
vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:
X hugs you.
ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyone but X and Y see:
X hugs Y.
cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X
types HUG X :
You hug yourself.
oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:
X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.
To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:
$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.
 
For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex, etc.
 
So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you would
do the following:
 
SOCEDIT NEW epoke
SOCEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SOCEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SOCEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SOCEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SOCEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SOCEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!
 
To get more examples, type SOCEDIT SHOW [social-name] to see one of the
existing socials.
 
The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editting of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.

Topic Neonates, Anarchs and Autarks~
Desc Neonate refers to a vampire who has been accepted and recognised by a
Prince, and thereby given a modicum of status in the city. As one of the
methods by which a new kindred can be allowed a continued existence,
this is a regular practice within the Camarilla and is also a necessary
social move for newcomers to a city.
Unless you've been recruited by the Sabbat, the other option available
to young kindred is to join the ranks of the anarchs. The anarch
movement is mostly made up of young vampires, but does count some elders
amongst their number. Refusing to belong to either institution of
kindred, the anarchs are largely disorganised and amorphous, existing on
the fringes of cities held by the Sabbat or Camarilla or forming their
own "Baronies" such as existed in the Anarch Free States along the west
coast of the USA.
A special class of unconnected kindred bears mention, the Autarks.
Autarks are the original anarchs, those who refused to comply with even
their own clans before there was an anarch movement. Autarks tend to be
older, reclusive vampires who often live somewhat hermitic lifestyles.
Generally, it is wise for younger kindred to avoid autarks on the off
chance that they take offense at the intrusion.

Topic Builder: VNUM~
Desc Vnum is the abbreviation for virtual number, a reference tag for items

For example, a mob and a room can have the same vnum, but two mobs
cannot.
Individual resets can be of the same mob or object vnum, however the
actual mob or object configurations cannot contain duplicate vnums.
Hence we can have multiple joggers created from the same mob vnum, but
we cannot have multiple mob types with the same vnum.

Topic Status, Rank, Fame~
Desc There are a number of types of status in Project Twilight, not all of
which have real meaning at this stage. At the same time these ideas may
be very important to some others, and often have serious implications.
Race status (also known as Rank to the werewolf population) carries a
number of meanings. For vampires this describes where a character lands
in the social pecking order, for werewolves it also increases the power
of gifts which they can learn.
Organisation status has no meaning yet, but once player created
organisations are worthwhile creating, there will be options for
improving org status and meanings associated with it dependant on what
your particular group associates it with.
Clan status recognises your position in the clan, tribe or kith. And
finally, fame is the character's recognition level in mortal society.

2 mob levels~
(null)~
(null)~
Topic OLC: Mob Levels~
Desc For those of you who were wondering, mob levels are a bit dodgy.  The
level of a mob needs to be a multiple of 25 for it to function at the
moment. Currently, the arrangement is, for an average, mortal-type mob,
the level should be set to 50. Weak mobs should be set to 25, and strong
mortal mobs should be at 75. Average supernatural mobs should be at 75,
weak at 50, and strong should be at 100 or in very strong cases 125.
Currently the system works like this:
Mob levels are divided by 25.  This number is then used to determine the
randomiser for the number of dots set in each skill and attribute, and
in the case of supernaturals, each power.  Ergo, currently if you set a
mob to have level 50 they have a chance to gain 3 in some things, but
are most likely to gain 2 or 1 in dot values.

life(?)style she can support, etc. At the lower levels this would enable
someone to have access to some basic funds, semi-decent clothing, maybe
a little apartment, while at the higher ones the sky is almost literally
the limit - expensive penthouses, cars, fancy suits, the works.

Topic Vampire: Caitiff~
Desc A sign of Gehenna, the Final Nights are surely coming with these
Clanless vampires; always unknowledgable of their own Sires, each
Caitiff has been released into the world after her Embrace without a
clue, with the powers of their vitae that seem to be coming to them
naturally, without guidance or other instruction.
Nearly always humiliated and shunned by other Cainites, especially of
the Camarilla, and sometimes even hunted for their potential to breach
the Masquerade by mistake through their ignorance, Caitiff are nearly
forced to become anarchs lacking any other place in the world to call
their own - too often it is either that, or join the Sabbat.

-1 Giovanni~
(null)~
(null)~
Topic Vampire Clan: Giovanni~
Desc The Giovanni Clan have been an oddity even among the Kindred from the
very beginning; their roots during the Dark Ages, when the Cappadocians
Embraced a small number of Italian merchants who then began - or had
already started even before then - to specialize in contacting the dead
for their own purposes. Quicky rising into power, that family launched a
major offensive against exactly those who brought them immortality,
eventually all but wiping out the entire Clan from existance.
Since then, the Giovanni have become a true financial power with their
undying fingers in every aspect of international crime, porn industry,
and drug trafic, as well as exercising and perfecting Necromancy over
the long centuries. Rumours have long since raged about the Clan's
internal ties, since they seem to be a single _family_, including ghouls
and still mortal servants - ties strong enough to often cross into
incest, it is said.
Today one of the Kindred's major forces in the financial and political
world, the Giovanni maintain a strict air of very careful neutrality,
offering services - mainly in the field of transportation - to all other
Kindred, always for a high fee or boon, with their base and throne of
power in central and northern Italy.

Topic Vampire Clan: Tzimisce~
Desc Clan Tzimisce, often referred to as "the fiends" by others - very rarely
to their face - are along with the Lasombra members of the Sabbat,
counterbalancing the Camarilla for world influence in the eternal game
of the Jyhad.

Founded and still basing their main strength in central Europe, this
Clan possesses (or, some would have it, has been possessed itself
by) a powerful Discipline that allows them to shape the flesh, bones and
physique of Cainite and mortal alike, allowing them to create powerful,
potent and oftentimes bizarre and freakish creatures; thinking that just
as a mortal resembles a first stage of evolution out of which he or she
may become a Cainite, thus the vampiric form may itself be but a stage
for - something - else to spring; the entire Clan seems to be intent on
discovering that something.

Topic Vampire Clan: Lasombra~
Desc Clan Lasombra is the one leading one of the Jyhad's two major sects, the
Sabbat, and with good reason; manipulative and efficient, sometimes
ruthless and always long-term planners and leaders of kine and Cainite
alike, these masters of shadows have dwelled in darkness for ages
untold, spinning their weaves and plans in the pursuit of power.

Their major strength coming not from the ability to physically bend
shadowy tendrils to their will and using it as its extensions to crush
their enemies but from their ability to blend in and take charge, Clan
Lasombra has been influencing the Christian Church for well over a
millenium, in the Dark Ages manipulating it to gain awesome political
influence over entire nations; even today, many of its members claim a
priest's robe, or are somehow tied to a monastery or similar sanctuary
of a divine nature.

(null)~
Topic Influence: Criminal~
Desc The world of crime offers lucrative possibilities to strong-willed
or subtle leaders.  Guns, money, drugs and vice - such delicious pastimes
can be led by anyone talented or simply vicious enough to take them.
   Underworld Influence lets you call on such favors for all manner of
illegal dealings, and its ranks are filled by the Mafia, La Cosa Nostra,
drug dealers, bookies, Yakuza, tongs, hitmen, fences and criminal gangs.
   The inception of the Mafia dates back to the Renaissance, and it's
entirely likely that a Kindred thought of the idea first.  Several clans
of Kindred have sparred over control of the Mafia for centuries, fueling
an already-volatile mix.
   The potential for violence, blood and easy answers to hard problems
brings a never-ending stream of new investors in this ancient profession.
The Camarilla has a solid foothold in the upper reaches of this Influence,
but that could change at any moment.  In particular, the arrival of the
Eastern vampires threatens the small grasp some Kindred have over the
tongs and triads in the various Chinatowns.

-1 political 'political influence'~
(null)~
(null)~
Topic Influence: Political~
Desc Deal-making is second nature to most vampires, so they can get along
very well with other bloodsuckers - that is, politicians.  Altering
party platforms, controlling local elections, changing appointed offices
and calling in favors all falls under the purview of Political
Influence.
   Well-timed blackmail, bribery, spin doctoring or any sundry tricks
are stock in trade on both sides of this fence.  Some of the likely
contacts and allies include pollsters, lobbyists, activists, party
members, spin doctors and politician from rural zoning committees to the
mayors of major cities or Congressional representatives.
   This is another high-profile Influence that many Kindred tend to
avoid at the upper levels.  Although younger ancillae recognize the
dizzying heights of power that such influence can bring, most Kindred
prefer to work behind the scenes, appointing the leaders of men rather
than serving the common good themselves.

(null)~
(null)~
Topic Police Influence~
Desc "To protect and serve" is the motto of the police, but these days,
Kindred and kine alike may have cause to wonder who is being protected
and served. That said, Police Influence can be very handy to assist with
the Masquerade, to protect one's holdings or to raid the assets of
another.

After all, attitude won't save the anarchs whose haven is the target of
a daylight raid.  Police of all ranks, detectives, clerical staff,
dispatchers, prison guards, special divisions (such as SWAT or homicide)
and local highway patrol make up these ranks.
~
End
-1 judicial 'judicial influence'~
(null)~
(null)~
Topic Judicial Influence~
Desc Since many of the operations that Cainites undertake are at least
marginally illegal, a good amount of sway over judges and lawyers is
indispensable.  Those Kindred who dabble in law often pull strings in
the courts to make sure that the questionable practices of Cainite
society go unnoticed and unpunished.

Of course, a little Legal Influence is also excellent for harassing an
enemy's assets, too.  Such Influence ranges from law schools and firms,
to lawyers, judges, DAs, clerks and public defenders.

The truly dedicated are not interested in just manipulating the law;
they want to shape it to fit their own desires.  Perhaps the heavy
influence of Kindred upon the law is the reason most lawyers have such
poor reputations.  Then again, perhaps not.  Like does attract like,
after all.

-1 media 'media influence'~
(null)~
(null)~
Topic Influence: Media~
Desc Directing media attention away from vampire activities is a key
component of the Masquerade.  Putting specific emphasis on certain
events can place an enemy in an uncomfortable spotlight or discredit a
rival.
With Media, you can crush or alter news stories, control the operations
of news stations and reporters and sway public opinion, with DJs,
editors of all varieties, reporters, cameramen, photographers and
broadcasters at your disposal.

-1 economic 'economic influence'~

(null)~
Topic Economic Influence~
Desc Manipulating markets, stock reports and investments is a hobby of
many Cainites, especially those who use their knowledge to keep hidden
wealth.
   Though your actual available money is a function of your Resources,
you can use Finance Influence to start or smother businesses, crush or
support banking institutions and alter credit records.
   Clearly, such power over money is not to be trifled with - fortunes
are made and destroyed with this sort of pull.  CEOs, bankers,
stockbrokers, bank tellers, yes-men, financiers and loan agents are
found among such work.
  The higher levels of Finance become a dizzying game for Kindred.  The
Cainite elders who were merchant princes during the Renaissance are in
awe of the stock market, let alone the pace of electronic money
transfers.  In this day and age, it takes very energetic Kindred to stay
on top of the financial world.  Many elders delegate this power to
younger Kindred.  As a consequence, this is one area where ancillae can
truly taste power. Elders, confident of their leash upon these upstarts,
allow their childer to play - as long as they get the results they
desire.

-1 church 'church influence~
(null)~
(null)~
Topic Influence: Church~
Desc Though the modern church has arguable less control over temporal
society than it did in the Middle Ages, its policies still exert
considerable influence over the direction of politics and communities.
Knowing the appropriate people allows insight into many mainstream
religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Shinto or
Buddhism (fringe or alternative groups, such as Scientology, are
considered Occult).  When you exercise Church Influence, you can change
religious policy, affect the assignment of the clergy and access a
variety of lore and resources.
   Contacts and allies affected by Church Influence would include
ministers, priests, bishops, Church-sponsored witch-hunters, holy orders
and various attendees and assistants.
   The Church is one of the most ancient bulwarks of Kindred Influence -
and the most dangerous.  In the World of Darkness, the Church still
keeps the truth about the supernatural locked away in its oldest
libraries.
   Kindred with high levels of Church Influence dare to use this power
to their own ends.  Most Kindred possessing level of Influence this high
can still remember the foundations of some of these faiths.

Desc Desert warriors, arab assassins, shadows in the dark, diablerists, much

true. Based in and coming from a supposedly secret stronghold somewhere
in the East for ages untold, united to some purpose under the banner of
their founder to whom they seem to refer to in the greatest respect,
these Cainites are keeping to themselves and holding onto a strange,
tenuous neutrality and code of beliefs.

There seem to be castes within the Clan, of whom only one - the
Warriors, internally referred to as Judges, for some reason  - was until
now prominent; but which the other castes in or what their functions, it
is unknown to all but the Children themselves.

Topic Builder: Introduction~
Desc This is not meant to be an end-all, be-all for new builders.  Instead,
this help is meant to provide some guidelines for building areas, rooms,
mobs and objects.  I intend to start with the help on Rooms first, since
that is what _EVERYONE_ looks at.  Let us begin.
Rooms are made up of two important parts: The name of the room and the
description.  The name of the room should be formatted so that it reads
like a book title.  All the words should be capped unless it is a word
like "the, a, an, etc..." unless it is the first room like: "The Storage
Shed" or "The Library".
Descriptions on the other hands should be _AT LEAST_ three sentences
long and no sense should be forgotten.  Players rely on the description
to tell them what is going on in the room.  Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste
and Touch are all important.  Most people rely too heavily on Sight, but
what about the other senses.  What does the room smell like, does it
have strange accoustics?  Most people do not understand how a room
tastes, but everyone know's what smoke tastes like.  Last, there is
touch. Are the walls textured?  Use your imagination.
Furthermore, if at all possible please avoid the use of the word "you"
in room descriptions. It detracts from the whole effect.

Werewolf: the Apocalypse, Changeling: the Dreaming, etc. - all
Trademarks of White Wolf Game Studio) characters are made. All game

demands of multiple plots and a sizable number of autonomous
personalities, as designed and released by the standard code and the
additions supplied by the storytellers.

Malkavians nonetheless command startling insight.  Does what they know
drive them to madness or does their insanity allow them too peer into a
world the rest of us fear to see?  Even other Damned fear the
Malkavians.
The cursed blood of their clan has polluted their minds, with the result
that every last Malkavian across the world is incurably insane.  What's
worse, a Malkavian's madness can take nearly any form, from overpowering
homicidal tendencies to near-catatonia.  In many cases, there's no way
to tell a Malkavian apart from the "sane" members of other clans.  Those
few whose psychoses are immediately obvious are among the most
terrifying vampires to stalk the streets.

{MDescription:
The three mental attributes relate to the intellectual capabilities of
the character. The character's ability for rational thought,
perceptiveness, and ability to think on their feet are all summed up by
these attributes.
 
{gPerception: To see, to hear, to smell, touch and taste, these are the
ways we experience our world. For characters, these senses and their
relativity acuity are summed up in the perception attribute. The
character's ability to notice and recognise influences and details in
their environment are also examples in which perception will come into
play.
 
{gIntelligence: The capacity for rational and lateral thinking are summed
up in the character's intelligence attribute. Anything which makes use
of the character's ability to think, plan, design or consider a course
of action and weigh its merit which does not require a reflexive
response is where the character must rely upon their intelligence score.
 
{gWits: Where intelligence is required for considered action, quick
responses and split second decisions are functions of the character's
wits attribute. Characters with high wits are quick on their feet and
good in tight situations.

affecting even the simplest of lives.

turn to let you draw from us and our humble creation a tale, an experience
of something other than the mundane.  Choose you the path of humanity,
undead, faerie-kin or shapechanger, all will lead you on in the story.  

Project Twilight is a mud based fairly closely on White Wolf Games' "World
of Darkness" games and associated products.  The mud currently sports
vampires, werewolves (kind of), and hunters all of which have their own
series of powers and abilities in addition to some more generic skills.

The MERC team, for carrying the torch forward and upward.
The ROM consortium, for all their hard work.
Erwin Andreasen, (apologies for spelling it's late) for his snippets.

Surreality and Locke, for the OLC engine.
And everyone's favourite AI experiment Eliza, for challenging me to do better.

in the room and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the 
mobile.  It is likely that resets will backfire if they are not

Unformatted Topic:  ROM
Description: ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In 
July of 1993, ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM. 
ROM was up for a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) 
was released, and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers 
of Mud under a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.
Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code.  It will 
be found at hypercube.org 6666, when it is opened.
The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:
Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen
New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen
Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth
Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)
Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)
Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)
Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander
Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world
Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug 
    reports and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches
New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the 
originator of the ASCII flags used in the zone files
ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release 
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code 
was written by Seth Scott (enchant armor, the new poofin/poofout), and 
many contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of 
Rusty's code from Moosehead also remain.
The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with 
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't 
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and 
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.
Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the 
changes to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late 
night of hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

Talents contain those abilities which are extensions of personality traits. 
Example: leadership, empathy, and brawl.  

Skills represent abilities which produce more tangible or physical results. 
Example: drive, repair, and survival.  Knowledges require greater studies
and generally have less tangible bases.  Example: law, science and occult.

Unformatted Topic: Roleplaying - Playing a Character
Description:
Roleplaying is the art of adopting a new persona, of creating a
fictional character and responding to events as that character would,
rather than as you as a player would respond. This is a rather
confusing distinction sometimes, and it does generally require some
practice, but adapting to a roleplaying environment can be a very
rewarding experience.
In essence, roleplaying is a form of free-form improvised acting. The
character may be close in personality to the actor, but there must
always be a certain degree of separation maintained to allow the
character to live and grow as a separate entity. Good roleplaying
almost always sees a character grow and develop, taking on a life of
its own and becoming a very definable and recognisable creature.
Project Twilight is meant as a roleplaying environment. We are seeking
to create a world of living beings whose interactions with one another
and their world at large create engaging stories of near boundless
scopes. We hope that you will join us in making this dream a reality.
Closed emotes, ie. emotes which define an action as an absolute
success, are only really reasonable where they do not affect another
character or mob within the mud. It should also be noted that
blatantly abusing players will have IC repercussions and is not going
to endear you to anyone.

Topic Characterization~
Desc Characterisation is a multi-faceted experience which should begin at
character creation.  A character is more than a set of vital statistics,
more than a character sheet.  A character is a living, breathing person from
a fictional world.  A character has a personality, motivations and flaws.  

In order to properly roleplay a character, one must define what that
character is aiming to be.  This is why Project Twilight gives you the space
to select a NATURE, DEMEANOR and CONCEPT for your character.  It is also the
reason we require you to have a description before you can receive
experience from roleplaying.

Topic Storytelling~
Desc Project Twilight is a storytelling game in the style of White Wolf's
games.  The idea of a storytelling game is to weave an engrossing tale for
the entertainment of all involved.  

In a story, the storyteller sets the scene and operates the non-player
characters with whom the players' character can interact.  A story has
aspects similar to a dramatic production, however the script is improvised
by the actors following the guidelines of each character's personality. 
Thus characters can develop and move the plot along in a fluid and natural
way, rather than being bound by too much overhead.  In scenes, the
storyteller's ruling on an action is final, and his or her decisions must be
accepted and respected.  If you are uncomfortable with the given situation
or distressed by the action in the scene, please notify the storyteller
immediately so that the scene can be stopped and the difficulty
circumvented.  We do not want to cause any person to be made uncomfortable
by the progression of a story.

some pointers as to how things should work. Anything which is not
covered by the command at this stage will be logged for future

Topic MOB Levels~
Desc For those of you who were wondering, mob levels are a bit dodgy.  The
level of a mob needs to be a multiple of 25 for it to function at the
moment.
Currently, the arrangement is, for an average, mortal-type mob, the
level should be set to 50. Weak mobs should be set to 25, and strong
mortal mobs should be at 75. Average supernatural mobs should be at 75,
weak at 50, and strong should be at 100 or in very strong cases 125.
Currently the system works like this:
Mob levels are divided by 25.  This number is then used to determine the
randomiser for the number of dots set in each skill and attribute, and
in the case of supernaturals, each power.  Ergo, currently if you set a
mob to have level 50 they have a chance to gain 3 in some things, but
are most likely to gain 2 or 1 in dot values at this stage as you can
imagine, but this being the case I'm going to have to bring forward some
things on here.

Topic Rebooting Project Twilight~
Syntax reboot - Resets the mud, kicking everyone off and starting fresh.
warmboot - resets the mud while maintaing player logins.
~
Desc Sometimes it becomes necessary to restart the mud. Whether this event
comes at a time when new code is being added or just when something
bizarre starts happening in the data sequence. In any case, normally a
warmboot is sufficient to set things right, however on occasion a full
reboot is necessary and should happen on a regular basis to prevent the
gradual memory bleed which can occur if a new piece of code is not
compatible with existing memory management code.
A warmboot resets does not completely clear all memory, which is worth
periodically doing.  It also leaves the mud running in it's original
process space, which may not be advisable when messing with memory
types.
