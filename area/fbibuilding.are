corpse hannah o'connor~
the corpse of Hannah O'Connor~
Hannah O'Connor lies here completely still and completely pale, she's
wearing a single piece white and flowery summer dress to hide her full
figure.  She has blood all over her dress, and several apparent wounds.  She
was stabbed once in the chest, once again across the neck.  There seems to
be a set of almost readable finger prints on each side of her neck.

Although the apparent wound of a sliced neck, x-ray's show her neck is also
broken.  This may be why she has her own dried blood along the upper part of
her neck ....

chest~
The odd thing about the chest wound is it seems the killer missed his mark
on the first 'go-round' and struck again just across the neck with a very
sharp instrument about three inches in length.

In Front of the FBI Office Building~
In front of the FBI offices building stand three tall flagpoles carrying
state, nation, and company flags each one flittering noisily in the wind. 
Noise from the garage entrance to the north seem to come in drafts or waves
seemingly to remind one that it's still there although mostly unseen.  The
darkly tinted windows of the building seem to look out at the world like
empty eye sockets, haunted by it's days of power and always struggling to
see once more.  The entrance to the building is to the west, the scent of
cigarettes can be smelled coming from the south while the sound of squealing
tires can be heard from the north.

Decorated only with a cement bench and a shiny metal ashtray overcrowded
with cigarette butts and the trash area filled with Styrofoam coffee cups,
this place is the designated smoking area for the FBI.  Caught smoking
anywhere else and it's against the rules!  A small sign in the grass reminds
people passing by to keep off the grass.  The front of the FBI offices

an office building.  A brightly lit hall continues north and west, while a

hang all along the walls here.  Each painting seems different from the last
but seem to be centrally themed somehow.

Incident: A pair of rabid dogs attacked at The Haven Hotel, injuring
numerous civilians before being put down by several anonymous
bystanders.  One dog was slain in a nearby parking lot and another was
found dead in one of the hotel hallways.
 
Jason Maddock, a policeman on the force for 3 years, was gunned
down in front of the Haven while responding to calls about the rabid
dogs.  His partner, Melissa Starks, responded to the gunshots she was
assaulted by a woman and two men and was left alive, but unconscious
outside the establishment.
 
Follow-up: [May-12-2004]:  Officer Melissa Starks was taken in to the local
hospital's emergency room for immediate treatment where blood, urine, and
skin samples were taken for further analysis.  It is undetermined at this time
what wounds she currently suffers from.  On the scene of the rabid dog incident
the dogs found were of mixed breed and only one of which had any identifying
tags on them.  The tags were on the dog found beheaded inside of The Haven
Hotel which identify the owners to live at 1691 Montgomery Dr. Bal Harbor.
Both of the dogs had some type of acidic fluid in their mouth shortly before
their deaths, samples were taken for further analysis of their saliva.

{WBuilt to look like a normal rifle most of this weapon is constructed
of a poly-resin/fiber composite for lightweight and insulation
properties. Called a PSC Gun which stands for Photo Static Conductor Gun
it takes the positively charged particles from it's clip and uses the
natural static in it's target as a type of homing device to unleash it's
lightning-like rounds.  This weapon is currently classified and is not

on it's side just under the sliding bolt.

Incident: A missing persons was filed on [Oct.-12-1992] for a Donna
Eldridge, 20, who at the time lived with her parents/legal guardians
John and Michelle Eldridge.  She was last seen at a local night club,
"Arc Lamp" with her sister Lisa, 17.  Lisa's stated that an older guy
calling himself Greg had actually wanted the two to go back to his room
for a party as the club itself was closing.  Donna left with Greg while
Lisa left for her parent's house.  This was the last time anyone saw
Donna alive.  Lisa described Greg as appearing around six foot, bleached
hair and a lightly muscled build.  Strong identifiable features were his
dimpled chin, and bushy eyebrows.  Donna is described as being an
overall "tomboy" and never dressing up more than she has to and
frequenting the gym more than she studied for classes.  Oddly enough she
was one of the few people in her family with naturally silver hair and
very dark gray-like eyes.
 
Follow-up: [Oct-20-1992]:  After questioning all of the local hotels and
apartments within the Bal Harbor area no clues came up as no one had
seen the artist conception of Lisa's description of Greg or Donna.  Greg
is currently wanted for questioning only.
 
[Jan-5-1993]:  Bal Harbor reported the arrival of a "John Doe " corpse
on [Oct-14-1992] and up until now were unable to identify the body.  The
police autopsy shows our "John Doe" was murdered very swiftly from
elongated claw like wounds all across his back made during or shortly
after intercourse.  Hair follicles that didn't match our "John Doe" were
found in dried blood samples on his back were sent to a crime lab in
D.C. for analysis, and came back matching a birth DNA sample from Donna
Eldridge. The DNA from a dried blood sample from John Doe was tampered
with during shipping and has been resubmitted for reanalysis.
 
[Jan-5-1993]:  Due to an odd turn in events both Greg and Donna are now
wanted for questioning.  Missing persons case K5779C amended by new case
file: M99811ZA opened for the murder of John Doe.
 
[Feb-12-1993]: DNA for "John Doe" returns with no matches, this officer
believes our "John Doe" is really the aforementioned Greg.

Small medium and large cages line the northern wall while huge glass vats
line the eastern wall with all the electrical components for the vats
crouched over by the southern wall.  Dried blood and animal hair can be seen
on the floor here and there.  A laboratory to the east is the only exit from

chemical equipment fill the tabletops in the room.  Lab gowns and facemasks
are kept in small sealed baggies and are encouraged to be worn before using
any laboratory equipment.  A specimen room can be seen to the west while the

A Dimly Lit Hallway~
A dimly lit hallway made to look larger than it really is by use of
creative architecture expands to the north and south.  A door to the west
from here has a sign that says Lab on it.  Old oil {Cpainting{gs hang on the
wall, each with specially engraved markings along the highly polished wooden
frames.  At the bottom of each painting is a golden plate with the title of

The face of a man is shown in close range and tilted to the side on a
metal table or something similar, the skin and muscles around the mouth
have been cleanly cut off to reveal a full set of teeth as well as the
upper and lower jaw.  A large incisor tooth can be seen protruding from
the upper jaw with a ruler placed next to it showing that it's a little
longer than a normal human tooth.

into the darkness.  More old {Cpainting{gs with intricately designed wooden

The Armory~
The bright white halogen lights and the faint smell of gunpowder are the
first things to hit the senses.  Being an armory the almost tangible smell
of gun oil hangs like a fog in the air, a smell so strong that it can almost
be tasted.  Gun racks of different sizes and shapes line the walls of this
room and various drawers hide even more weapons of destruction.  A shooting
range can be seen to the west while the exit lies to the east.

The Practice Range~
White lights shine down from the ceiling in this room and the smell of
spent gunpowder overtakes the smell of gun oil as if in an unseen war, much
like the one project twilight stands for.  This room is kept spotless as all
the guns used here are given brass catchers and dust is nowhere present. 
Several shooting booths stand here allowing hunters to practice their skills
on dummies rather than the real thing.

United States Postal Office #12574~
This old brick building, which was made during this city's original
settling, boasts very few amenities found in the buildings of today which
all have indoor plumbing, and central heat and air.  This single room
building does boast a nice window front which allows the outdoor air to
circulate through the building although lately a pair of window air
conditioning units have made their home there.  Stacks of mail line up
behind small wooden counter and inside various mail carts waiting to be
sorted and delivered.

Western Entrance of the City Park~
The cheap urban tract of the western suburbs provide the backdrop for
this park entrance.  Though it is smaller than the large plaza at the
eastern entrance, it is even more run down.  Bright wildstyle street art has
been sprayed over every possible flat surface, the ground included.  The
equiment of the childrens playground that sits at one side of the plaza is
either broken or so rusty that it is completely unusable by anyone and
judging by the used syringes that are scattered all over the ground it is a
junkies paradise as well.  In the centre of the plaza there is a wide,
shallow pool that is almost completed choked by leaves and other debris.  At
some time in the past, the southern edge of the plaza was set up with stools
and tables for playing chess, now all that is left is their charred remains.

Lincoln Ave~
Busy Lincoln Ave roars with the traffic flying past.  The street itself
is relatively well-kept, but less can be said for the fairly industrial area
bordering it.  Many of the buildings are monoliths of the previous economic
high times when jobs were plentiful and life was good for most sectors of
the community.  The area has long since fallen into some serious disrepair.

Cafe's spill out onto the sidewalk, on this part of Coleman Street, and
there are clean, new windows displaying the boutiques wares yet boarded up
shops are still more numerous than the newly renovated ones.  About midway
along the street the bitumen gives way to brick red and slate colored
cobblestones that lead up to the shiny new shopping mall and its large
parking lot.

A thick line of trees just off the side of the road block the view to the
east and west down this part of Second Avenue.  The pavement all along this
part of the street seem to be patched here and there and makes for an
uncomfortable drive.  A large hotel can be seen to the south while a small
intersection can be seen to the north.
