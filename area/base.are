m16a2 a2 m16 rifle~
an M16-A2 rifle~
A black, non reflective rifle sits here.~
The rifle is a 5.56-mm, magazine-fed, gas-operated, shoulder-fired
weapon. It is designed to fire either semiautomatic or a three-round
burst through the use of a selector lever (SAFE, SEMI, and BURST). It
can be indentified from early M16 rifles by the addition of the spent
case deflector and the forward assist on the M16A2. The M16A2 variant
was adopted by the US Marine Corps in 1983 and the US Army adopted it in
1985.
