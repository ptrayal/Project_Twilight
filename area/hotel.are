picture small photograph~
a small professionally-made photograph~
This picture seems to be one of a series of a local musician.  The womanin question is perched on a chair, dressed in scanty lingerie.  Her coloringis singularly odd, with creamy, almost pure-white skin, lusterously longlocks of vibrant fuschia that drape over her shoulders, and matchingeyebrows and lashes.  One of her pale, ruby-hued eyes is closed in a wink,the pose is innocent and provocative: she sits on the edge of the chair,leaning back, one slender leg raised in the air as she rolls down alace-trimmed silk stocking.  Although most of the clothing that she iswearing is nothing more than a few scraps of black lace, it is still opaqueand decent enough to display in most magazines and advertisements.  By thepicture's contents, it's easy to surmise that this photograph may have beenslated for use in promotional items for the musical artist.  ~

A Turn in the Hallway Under the Stairs~
This room is pitch black.  The nondescript cement floor is covered with afaintly tinted red liquid of some type.  The plain brick walls here seem toextend into more darkness.  A set of short wooden stairs leads up into thedarkness above.  The hallway here extends northwards towards the sound ofdripping water, and westwards towards the sound of very faint yet heavy bassmusic.  ~

Under the Stairs~
This room is pitch black.  The nondescript cement floor is covered withpuddles of old rain water from the last time it rained.  The plain brickwalls here seem to extend into a small room with nothing in it.  A set ofold metal stairs leads up into the darkness above.  There is a small crackin the wall west of here towards the sound of very faint yet heavy bassmusic.  ~

The End of a Black-Lit Hallway~
The eerie black lights continue east making it hard to make things outclearly, and the cement flooring seems to be glowing.  A small crack in thewall west of here leaves just enough room to squeeze through.  Plain redbrick with small pipes and tangles of wires make up the walls here.  Heavybass music can clearly be heard at this point of the hallway which seems tobe coming from the south.  Muffled voices can be heard coming from a doorwayjust north of here.  ~

Inside an Office~
This small office holds just enough room for a desk and a small walkway. The old, and cracked brick walls show through here and there where thedrywall has given way to years of no care.  The floor is little more than abunch of rugs piled on top of each other to provide for a very un-keptappearance.  There is a door south of here, and a door north of here.  ~

On a Security Platform~
Climbing up the small metal ladder built into the wall leads up to asmall security platform from which the whole club can be seen.  The ceilinghangs low enough to remind this place is still underground, and the metalgrate flooring here looks almost unsafe.  This walkway is just big enoughfor one person at a time to walk on.  The heavy bass music and flashy lightsaren't actually as bad up here.  ~

A Black-Lit Hallway~
Heavy bass music can clearly be heard at this point in the hallway whichappears to be coming from a doorway just west of here, while a hint ofordinary light can be seen to the east.  The black lights make things hardto see in here however, and the cement flooring seems to be glowing.  Plainred brick with small pipes and tangles of wires make up the walls here.  ~

A Black-Lit Hallway~
This room is faintly lit by the light filtering through the hangingplastic sheets to the north.  Plain cement floors, and red brick walls withwires and small pipes running all along them make up the atmosphere here.  Avery cold draft can be felt coming from the door to the north.  To the westthose irritating black lights make everything look funny, while dimlylighting the rest of the hallway; that bass music is getting louder too. Darkness prevails to the east.  ~

The one place in the club that is using actual light, although not a lotof it.  There is two small overhead lamps that peer down directly on the barso that the bartender can see the exchange of money.

The Hot Spot~
Looking around the sheer elegance and beauty that makes up this roommakes one wonder what type of person lives here.  The cream colored wallsgive the soft lighting in this room the extra reflection it needs to projectall over the room.  The door boundaries are painted in a deep burgundy colorthat seem to soak in any light that hits it, making viewing one room fromthe next near impossible.  There are several larges pieces of oak furniturethat were most likely all made by the same person as they all have the sameknot work carvings that happen to also match the closet doors.  From theoversized bed that sits in the center of the room which is fully enclosed byit's white sheer canopy and the vanity in the far corner of the room whichis covered with all kinds of different products and makeup, to the big overstuffed chair that is sitting in the corner opposite the vanity with a smalltable and lamp sitting next to it.  There is a book written in Italiansitting on the table that you can tell has been read often.  Between thestuff on the vanity, the ruffled covers on the bed and the different thingslying around the room it becomes obvious this place is lived in and must bequite comfortable.  ~

Along Second in Front of a Hotel~
The shadow under the hotel canopy seems ominous compared to the gloom
around the rest of the street.  The canopy itself seems harmless, as it is
made of plain green vinyl that has been worn over the years from the weather
and the passing traffic.  A small red rose sits above the white bold
lettering on the canopy, which spell out: THE HAVEN.  To the west is the
entrance to the hotel, and to the north there seems to be a parking lot for
those brave enough to stay the night.

An ancient looking chandelier hangs from the high ceiling here, allowing

smell coming from the south, and the lobby continues west towards the sounds
of elevators humming quietly.  A small sign is on the counter.

It winds up several floors above thisroom as well, while gripping tightly to the dusty brick walls which probablyhave seen better days.  ~

The old and cracked asphault here has faint lines for no parkingoverlapped by other faint yellow lines for parking spaces.  The nearby hotelseems to cast an ominous shadow over everything here.  ~

The Hotel Lobby~
An ancient looking chandelier hangs from the high ceiling here, allowing
the light to drift down slowly and reflect up from the well polished yet
weathered black and white checkered tile floors.  The egg white wallpaper
seems as old as time itself.  There seems to be some kind of rank smell
coming from the south, and a quiet hallway begins to the west.  To the north
sits a pair of elevator doors.  <ooc> 'press button' to call the elevator,
and 'enter elevator' to go inside.

Intersection in a Quiet Hallway~
The gray carpet that once flooded this intersection has finally been worndown to threads, and the padding underneath sits here poking out from underthe its' hiding spot.  All along the hallway here there seems to be longbranches of mildew growing on the walls; all of a sudden you realize it'sabsolutely, and totally quiet.  ~

The road begins to dip down towards the north into a dark alley whichruns down past an overshadowing hotel on the west side of the street.  Mostof the pavement seems to be cracked up pretty badly but is still drivable. From the west a window from the first floor of the hotel peers out at you.  ~

Paintings of outdoor scenery line the walls here and there all along thehall here.  They all seem to portray different landscape, much unlike thishallway.  Its monotonous pattern, and squeaky-clean visage seem almost afront of some type.  ~

A Quiet Hallway~
The black and white checkered tile seems to come to an end just east ofhere, where the hallway takes an abrupt turn to the north into some kind ofroom.  The egg white paint on the walls helps the scenic paintings to standout with their golden frames.  Suddenly the thought of how eerily quiet thishallway is comes to mind.  ~

This room is barely lit due to the flickering halogen bulbs that resideon the plain cement ceiling here.  The walls are plain brick, with old lint,and small cobwebs all over the place.

Within a Mahogany Stall~
The interior of this stall is much like the exterior, with four importantdifferences: a toilet, a toilet paper dispenser, a seat cover dispenser, anda lidded can for disposing of certain produscts.  The floor itself isfilthy.  Covered with dried urine, vomit, and some faeces on the side - it'samazing tthere is air enough to breathe.  The two dispensers appear to beempty from their respective tissues, and the stainless steel cannister isalmost hidden behind the toilet.  ~

Privacy and simplicity seem to be two key factors to this room.  Thegray, plush carpet seems to be mashed down in certain areas near the bed,but other than that this room looks just as elegant as the last room withthe stonewall wallpaper, and it's own large screen television.  ~

White tile picks up in this room where the gray carpet left off in thebedroom just north of here.  The walls, also covered in small white tiles,make this room feel like a cage almost.  But every fancy hotel room needs ahot tub of it's own.  It's pretty much a law of some kind.  ~

Laundry Room~
This room is barely lit due to the flickering halogen bulbs that resideon the plain cement ceiling here.  The walls are plain brick, with old lint,and small cobwebs all over the place.  The black and white checkered tilefloor seems as if it has never been cleaned.  Compared to the rest of thesecond floor this place looks pretty bad.  ~

Laundry Room~
This little corner is home to a large dryer spewing lint and smoke allover the place.  The air itself seems toxic due to the lint, which seems togive the brick walls an extra layer of insulation.  The black and whitecheckered floor is covered with it as well.  The laundry room continuessouth from here towards the smell of laundry detergent ~

It winds up to the roof from here, whilegripping tightly to the dusty brick walls which probably have seen betterdays.  ~

The Den~
A ceiling fan hangs high up in the room from the ceiling.  It illuminatesthis well spaced room, with it's plush gray carpeting and three dimensionalwallpaper which looks as if an old stone wall had been built to protect thisroom and it's occupants.  ~

A Bedroom~
Privacy and simplicity seem to be two key factors to this room.  Thegray, plush carpet seems to be mashed down in certain areas near the bed,but other than that this room looks just as elegant as the last room withthe stone wall wallpaper, and it's own large screen television.  ~

A Bathroom and Spa~
White tile picks up in this room where the gray carpet left off in thebedroom just north of here.  The walls, also covered in small white tiles,make this room feel like a cage almost.  But every fancy hotel room needs ahot tub of it's own.  It's pretty much a law of some kind.  ~

A Quiet Hallway on the Fourth Floor~
This all black hallway is simply designed with no eye pleasers.  Thereare the simple flat black walls, with the marble black tiled floor, and aflat black ceiling.  The lighting here, what little there is of it, comesfrom a single round hole in the ceiling from which halogen lightmysteriously pours.  To the north sits a pair of elevator doors.  <ooc>'press button' to call the elevator.  ~

End of a Quiet Hallway~
The all black hall ends here abruptly, while a small room can still beseen to the south.  The rest of the hall extends west.  A single round holein the ceiling allows a halogen light to give a shadowy aspect to thehallway.  ~

Laundry Room~
This room is barely lit due to the flickering halogen bulbs that resideon the plain cement ceiling here.  The walls are plain brick, with old lint,and small cobwebs all over the place.  The black and white checkered tilefloor seems as if it has never been cleaned.  Compared to the rest of thesecond floor this place looks pretty bad.  ~

Laundry Room~
This little corner is home to a large dryer spewing lint and smoke allover the place.  The air itself seems toxic due to the lint, which seems togive the brick walls an extra layer of insulation.  The black and whitecheckered floor is covered with it as well.  The laundry room continuessouth from here towards the smell of laundry detergent ~

The Kitchen~
This kitchen is spotless.  The small, squared white tile that lines thewalls and floor is perfectly clean as if it has never been used.  The strongodor of something decaying can be smelled from here, but it can't quite bedetermined where it's coming from.  A storage room is to the east, while therestaurant is to the west.  ~

This small room reeks of decaying, or decomposing flesh.  A singlefilament bulb hangs on its power cord from the ceiling.  The cement walls,floor, and no ceiling show the managers' true intent of being a tightwad.  ~
