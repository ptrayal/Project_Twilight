Danny Faggio~
Some crazy guy wanders around.~
A large heavy-set man, apparently in his forties, clad in a (formerly)white t-shirt and gym shorts.  What's left of his black curly hair is greasyand streaked with gray.  He wears a dirty white hankershief over his mouthand nose.  No doubt that the spew of senseless mutterings and profanitiesthat issue from his cake hole on a regular basis are to compensate for hisbathing on a cleary irregular basis.  Yes, definately going places. Preferably Bellevue.  ~

"Circle Limit III," by M.C. Escher~
Picture of "Circle Limit III"~
This work is composed of a large number of fish within a circle.  Thefish are represented by four colors: red, blue, yellow and green.  Eachcolor of fish falls into a single series that moves in one direction; allthe fish of the same series swim after one another, head to tail, along acircular course from edge to edge.  The more closely they approach thecenter, the larger they become.  The further from the center they are, thesmaller they become until finally all four colors blur together.  When onesquints at the print, it appears much like an image from a kaleidoscope.  ~

print picasso~
"Two Figures and a Cat" by Pablo Picasso~
A watercolored drawing of a woman in bed being eaten by her boyfriendwhile a cat looks on.  Her eyes, heavy on the mascara, are closed as shemoans in delight.  She's holding his hand and rubbing his back with onefoot.  The cat, stationed on the edge of the bed at the top of the pictureand watching teh action, is light brown in color.  The bed is clearlybackground, most of the detail has been devoted to the couple and theirspectator.  This looks as much as something Picasso knocked off to pass thetime as much as it looks like a serious piece of work.  Overshadowed by hislater works, this is a very rare print from around 1900, towards thebeggining of Picasso's career.  ~

Off the Wall~
The entrance to this shop passes through a small nook between two large,
glass display cases lined with t-shirts emblazoned with logos and images of
various "alternative" bands, ranging from 'the Butthole Surfers' and 'the
Cure' to 'Marilyn Manson.  ' The interior of the store proper seems to offer
something for everyone; such things as joke greeting cards, disassembled
drug paraphenalia, lava lamps, posters and toys of an adult nature.  The
checkout counter sits along the southern edge of the shop near the door and
a sizable rack of imported cigarettes, clove cigarettes and cigars lines the
entire wall behind it.

Dakota Art Supplies~
Like most of the shops along Broadway, the interior of this establishmentis small in size.  Large shelves mounted with rolling ladders compensate forthe lack of space by building up rather than out.  Divided by medium, eachrack holds a variety of art supplies; compressed charcoal, tubes of oilpaint, modeling clay, vine charcoal, watercolors, and dozens of othersupplies all are represented in a variety of colors and prices.  The rear ofthe store contains a small selection of artists' portfolios, bags and boxesfor the easy transportation of both work and tools.  The western end of theshop is dedicated to modeling-figures made of everything from wood to metaland offering a large range of sizes and flexibility.  ~

Golden Age Thriftshop~
The interior of this store is much longer than it is wide, looking muchlike a tunnel in shape.  Nearly every inch of the floor is covered by acircular rack of clothing, all of it fondly referred to as vintage.  All ofthe clothing appears to be clean and bereft of holes, and most of theinventory is composed of the more extreme fashion statements from theirrespective eras.  Bellbottoms, hotpants, wide-collared shirts and evenparachute pants are commonplace.  The few employees in the store look as ifthey recently escaped from an episode of "Welcome Back Kotter," completingthe illusion.  A small orange curtain covered in stylized daisies separatesthe store from an even smaller dressing room to the east.  ~

One of the more active shopping districtsin town, the sidewalks on either side of the street have been widenedconsiderably to provide pedestrians more freedom of movement.  All along thesidewalks are visible brass footprints which have been imbedded in theconcrete.  Each pair of footprints features a number and a name; the name atthis set of prints appears to be "the Waltz," and the numbers seem toindicate the correct order of steps for performing the dance.  To the eaststands a small neighborhood grocery, while a poster shop to the westfeatures a glass display case with a variety of prints.  Broadway continuesthrough the district to the north.  ~

Branching off the main street, this alley forms a narrow "U" between
thebordering buildings.  While not quite as bright as Broadway due to
theshadows cast from the structures to the north and south, enough light
existsto make out the relative cleanliness of the alleyway.  The pavement
featuresa few covered potholes, but otherwise is in remarkable condition.  A
seriesof concrete posts on the alley's eastern end restricts traffic
topedestrians.  Broadway is clearly visible to the east, while the alley
comesto a halt just to the west.

A glass counter sits at the end of the room displayingplates of cheese and fruit as well as bottles of expensive wine.  Behindthis is an espresso machine, and next to that, a small window the cook usesto deliver food to the wait staff.  There appears to be no menu anywhere inthe place.

The paintings in this room are as missmatched as the furniture.  Thereis a portrait of a stuffy-looking woman done in a Renaissance style nextto a vague watercolor of amorphous blues and greens.  There is also avery well executed still life.  The vase depicted in this paintingcontains the distorted reflection of two people doing something verynaughty indeed, but only an accute eye and close examination will revealthis.~

The temperature in this room isconsiderably higher than either of the adjoining rooms, so a large ventblows cold air down over its occupants.

Outside the Afterlife~
During the day the building to the north appears to be a mundanewarehouse.  The only indication that it might be something else is theframework for a large neon sign.  At night that sign lights up in meter talllettering that shifts in color from deep blue to yellow to a bright red andthen back again.  These letters spell out in a crisp designer font"Afterlife".  When the sign is activated there is often a long line ofpeople spilling out onto the sidewalk.  At night men and women que in frontof the large double doors of the Afterlife.  It is a strange mix of rubbercorsets & piercings, glow sticks & baggy pants, and designer suits & LouisVuitton bags.  These three separate groups do the best they can to ignorethe others' presence.  Above the crowd a gangly man stands like some carniefrom hell.  He seems far too tall, made taller by his top hat and cane.  Hisskin is stretched over his frame tightly, giving him more than a passingresemblance to a skeleton.  He calls out to passers by, "Come one Come allto the Afterlife!"  Two huge bouncers stand behind him, checking Ids andkeeping the crowd under control with their menacing glances.  The carniehimself seems to be the one who picks who gets into the club and whodoesn't, blessing lucky people in the line with a nod and a gesture of hissilver-tipped cane.  ~

The night and fresh air creeps into the Afterlife from the south.  Thereappears to be a candle-lit lounge north while stairs up and down sit oneither side of the hallway.  ~

Purgatory~
Unlike the grating to the south, this floor is hardwood.  Large rugs havebeen laid to support deep backed-velvet couches, better suited in aVictorian movie.  They are flanked by end and coffee tables made of richwoods and sporting decorative filigrees.  There are also inviting leatherlounges.  Candles hang in candelabras, they float in decorative bowls, andrest in etched votive holders.  The music played is soft and rests in thebackground.  A straight and sophisticated wooden bar stands here.  Theglasses and bottles behind it are lined up in precise rows.  Instead of amirror, patrons look across the bar at paintings of horses and rolling greencountryside.  ~

This was once the short lived DVD King store.  Now it's just a thirty bysixty foot empty space with crumbling walls and boarded windows.  The door,also boarded up, leads east onto Broadway, which one can peek out ontothrough the cracks.  ~

Broadway~
The busy street reaches its midpoint here, the two lanes of asphaltconstantly besieged by both traffic and pedestrians.  Brass footprints havebeen embedded within the concrete at regular intervals, each set immitatingthe footwork of a popular dance.  The Polka appears to be the dance ofchoice at this interval, and a passerby can occasionally be seen testing outtheir moves by placing their feet atop the imprints.  Along the easternblock of buildings can be seen a large furniture store, its glass displayfeaturing leather couches.  A small alleyway is visible to the west, itsentrance blocked by concrete poles to prevent traffic from passing through. Broadway continues to both the north and south.  ~

The northern section of Broadway begins here, passing by shops amidst thehustle and bustle of inner-city traffic.

Brass footprints embeddedwithin the concrete sidewalks illustrate dance steps for passing shoppers,the dance at this particular juncture being the Hustle.  To the west standswhat appears to be a women's clothing boutique, while a small art supplystore to the east features a selection of easels in its window display. Broadway continues to both the north and south.  ~

Broadway continues through the shopping district, passing byantique-looking iron streetlamps which give an old-word feel to the area. The wide sidewalks flank the narrow street on either side, imbedded withbrass footprints designed to give brief dance instructions to shoppers.

To the west can beseen a lively restaurant, while a thrift shop offers affordable clothing tothe east.  Broadway continues to both the north and south.  ~

Retro Viva~
This small clothing boutique is both chic and exclusive, ground zero forwomen of the subculture elite.  Carrying everything from blouses and skirtsto brightly-colored hair dye and outrageous footwear, few things but theaforementioned dye feature a price tag with less than three digits.  This isnot a place to purchase an entire wardrobe for anyone other than theindependently wealthy goths and divas of the world, who could likely becounted on one hand; rather, it is a place to pick up a signature piece, adesigner original around which to build an outfit.  While the prices do varywidely, even simple t-shirts appear to be selling for thirty dollars apiece.Much like the merchandise, the staff of the store seems to exist in its ownlittle world.  Rather than approaching customers, they take a hands-offattitude, pretending not to notice the clientele until beckoned for oraddressed.  A black velvet curtain on the west wall leads to the shop'sdressing room.  ~

Orpheus Records~
Relatively small in size, this little record shop is packed to therafters with shelves holding compact disks and cassette tapes.  The easternwall of the establishment is made up of large plate-glass windows, allowinga generous amount of light to fill the place during the majority of businesshours.  A small L-shaped counter on the southern side of the building nearthe entrance holds a cash register for customer checkout.  A metal stairwayin the southwestern corner leads up to a large balcony overlooking thestore, upon which rest more shelves holding old LP records.  On either sideof the main entrance stand theft-detectors, helping to cut down onshoplifting.  ~

Orpeus Records, Second Floor~
This balcony is composed of interlocking metal sheets, similar inappearance to those found on catwalks.  The overall affect allows customersto see the main store below, while also giving employees at the register aclear view of customers overhead.  While the arrangement makes it awkwardfor customers to wear skirts or dresses on the balcony, it also helps toprevent customers of all genders from helping themselves to five-fingerdiscounts.  The racks on this level are little more than a series of boxeswith legs, each holding approximately thirty records.  ~

Twice-Sold Tales~
The one-stop shop for used books, this store offers everything anyonecould ever want in paper products with spines.  Every inch that isn'tabsolutely necessary has been covered with bookshelves, most of themreaching to the top of the ceiling.  Each shelf holds a different type oftext, as is common with most bookstores.  Interestingly, narrow boards runacross the tops of the shelves, connecting them all like small timberbridges.  Occasionally a plump cat can be seen using one of these improvisedcrossings, apparently the establishment's furry mascot.  A large bin at thefront of the store holds copies of overstock such as Harlequinn Romancenovels, each priced at 75-cents.  ~
