A fountain spewing blood from the mouths of gaping skulls.~
The skulls may be concrete, but the blood is real, thick and vibrant. 
It's amazing how the artist has captured each of the skulls in such a way
that their mouths seem to be open in silent screams.  The blank sockets seem
to be watching, as if some sentience remains to turn baleful gazes upon
passers-by.

The large and overgrown city park tangles grandly on the east side of theroad while opposite it is the remains of the old city center.  Old hotelsthat have seen better days display what little remaining parts of their oncestately grandeur they had, however cracks in this facade are easily seen. Deep, dark alleyways that are filled with all manner of rubbish sitinbetween the tightly packed hotels only slightly lit by garish neon signsthat flash day and night attempting to entice the unwary.  At night, underthe neon glow, the streetwalkers roam, giving the hotels a reason to stayopen and for the traffic to flow.  ~

An old cinema lies on the western edge of the road here.  Once upon atime it must have certainly been the toast of the town, displaying allmanner of red carpet events.  Now, the billboard is fading, the posters andthe main sign show clearly that the movies now playing are all rated to fitin with the theme of the area around it.  Across the road the dark anddangerous park looms, the roots of the huge and wild trees have lifted thefootpath in many places, almost as if they were trying to reclaim the cityone bit at a time.  ~

The Corner of Montgomery and Second~
The traffic lights slowing cycle through their colours, the highest ofthem mostly obscured by overhanging trees.  Here on the corner of Montgomeryand Second is an ever present 7-11 that is opened twenty-five hours a dayand on the opposite side is an old gas station that has been boarded up andcompletely covered in graffiti.  To the south, Second Avenue continues onwith park side townhouses that are even less savory than the hotels thatline the rest of the thoroughfare.  Heading west is the more industrial sideof town, what was once the powerhouse of the city, now barely a shell oflight industry.  ~

A few old apartment blocks sit above the newer, more drabconcrete fabrications of street side shops and dull offices.  It is thoughany character has been washed out and carefully replaced with large cementblocks that have windows.  There is little here to keep anyone interested.  ~

Huge industrial bins sit at the side of a small furniture outlet, quiteclose to the road.  They are seemingly always filled to overflowing,spilling packing tape, boxes and other rubbish all over the ground.  Small,stunted and dying gardens separate the street from the carparks and toweringmetal light poles are planted into the ground, almost like trees.  Duringthe day these areas are filled with busy workers, after nightfall it is aghost town as they have all gone home.  ~

In the distance and towards the southlarge smoke stacks, both new and old, can be seen in the sky line.  Jammedinto the space around here, however, is light industrial complexes and largeshop fronts.  Furniture stores, bedding specialists, lighting experts, tooltraders and mostly empty used car lots all can be found in and around thispart of the city.  Side streets wind off both north and south, heading intoeven more industrial areas while to the east the city park can now befaintly seen.  ~

Here is the very heart of the light industrial district in the city.  Carlots line the east-west thorough-fare on one side and budget housing mixesin with new large vehicle repair chain stores.  The roads are littered withrubbish and what little greenery there is, is all stunted and mostly dying. This is a bleak urban place, devoid of any character or soul, even thetraffic seems to zoom by with little desire to stop.  ~

To the east the city centre can just be seen while much smallerroads lead off in all the other two directions.  A small convenience storesits on the corner here, providing lunch and soft drinks to any of theworkers that they can.  A large self-storage yard dominates one side of theroad with a warren of locked sheds hidden away behind its large glassfacade.  On the opposite side of the road, matching the size of theself-storage place is a huge Ikea superstore.  ~

Instead of factory outlets andbuilding supply stores, there are now manufacturing plants.  Huge warehousesized factories sit behind high barbed-wire security fences, designed tokeep the casual curious out.  Huge, ugly sheet metal factories, filled tothe brim with minimum wage, unskilled labour is the decor and this area doesit so well.

with the city's new policy of restoring historical landmarks like the post
office to the south.  The old brick building stands with it's face to the
street and a large United States flag flowing with the wind that tells the
world we're proud of who we are.  Other government restored historical
buildings line this street to the east and west.

The street dead ends in a circle to prevent the heavy flow of traffic
from becoming worse by having to actually use the three-point turn method in
the middle of traffic.  To the south stands what was once the tallest
building in Bal Harbour, and is still used as the town hall to this day
while to the north the rear side of the police department can be seen in all
it's glory.  The street continues west from here.

The Heart of the City~
Here in the midst of the tall concrete and glass sentinels is the
entrance to the neglected heart of the city.  Large, dirty flagstones have
been laid in geometric patterns around an old ornate fountain that is in
dire need of a touch-up.  The pool surrounding the fountain is missing a
number of its tiles giving it a sickly, pockmarked aspect.  The pool also
has underwater spot-lights that illuminate the statuesque fountain, some of
them are broken, making the statue look somewhat more chaotic at night. 
Added to the fountain's woes, one of the arms from the statue is lying
broken at its own feet in the pool below.  It is obvious that misuse and
neglect has taken its toll and the more timid folk of the city avoid this
place, making it an ideal meeting place for others.  The main thoroughfare
of Third Avenue runs north and south, bisecting the city.  To the west is
the rest of the massive city park and to the east is the start of the
shopping precinct of the city.

blocks line the road on the western side and the east has the backdrop of
the long neglected and overgrown park.  Paper of all sorts litters the
streets, simply adding to the rundown and neglected aspect of the area. 
Adding to the woe of this place, there is a faint, damp odour wafting in

A bootleg liquor store and just further along a rundown, one-stop
pornshop only adds to the general ambience of this part of town.  The street
is pockmarked heavily with potholes and the closer to Delaney Street in the
south, the heavier the graffiti seems to be.  Squat, ugly apartment blocks
line the road on the western side and the east has the backdrop of the long
neglected and overgrown park.  Paper of all sorts litters the streets,
simply adding to the rundown and neglected aspect of the area.  There is the
lingering scent of an open sewer somewhere close by.

Third Avenue~
Here even the sidewalk has graffiti spray painted on it, as does every
wall and post.  The street has potholes and divets out of it all over the
place, looking in dire need of resurfacing.  Obscuring any view of the wild
tangle of the park to the east is an large, unsightly apartment block that
looks more like a demolition site than a residence.  No windows are unbroken
and most are boarded up with wood or black sheet plastic.  Paper of all
sorts litters the streets, simply adding to the rundown and neglected aspect
of the area.  There is a very faint waft of decay coming from somewhere, as
if there an open sewer somewhere in the area.

At the Duck Pond~
No paddle boats or sunbathers to be found here.  Rather there is a trail
of used hypodermic needles and other garbage littering the groud everywhere.
The remains of a once proud duck pond have been choked with all manner of
garbage from the modern world.  The pond was once a proud mantlepiece of the
city, however, just like the park, it has long since fallen.  It has become
a convenient dumping ground for the lazy city folk and a foul, overwhelming
odor hangs like a cloud over the stagnant remains of the pond.

A Concrete Path~
A narrow concrete path winds its way around tthe contours of the green
mounds that make up the park.  Trees are growing unkempt with leaves and
rubbish littering the grounds and in other places wild gardens have nearly
overgrown the pathways.  Battered lamp posts that are marked with graffiti
stick out of he greenery haphazardly with seemingly more broken ones than
working, giving only sporadic illumination at night.  Every so often a bench
can be seen half covered by weeds and street art, with garbage piling up
under them and the nearby overflowing rubbish bin.

Corner of Second and Patterson~
A busy Second Avenue runs north and south here, stretching the length ofthe massive City park and beyond.  Old hotels with heritage stylearchitecture line the northern side of Second Avenue making the most of thepark views and the dirty city skyline.  On the southern side of Secondinbetween the older apartment buildings there is run down theatre that hasseen better days and has its doors chained shut.  The hotels are open allhours, some being the sort that bill by the hour making this part of townone of the busiest.  Heading west through the ugly urban tract of apartmentblocks and industrial infrastructure is Patterson Street, which judging bythe small blue sign with an aeroplane on it leads to the airport.  ~

Coleman Street (East/West)~
Only a short walk from the heart of the city, this part of Coleman
Street has suffered the same fate, falling into disrepair and neglect.
A once thriving streetside specialty shopping district has been bypassed
by both urban renewal elsewhere in the city and giant shopping malls.
Boards, chain-mesh or metal bars cover the windows of the small boutique
shops and the once proud signs overhead are now peeling or sprayed over
with tags and other graffiti. There is a great sense of emptiness and
transience.

Coleman Street (East/West)~
Slowly retail is reclaiming this part of Coleman Street under the shadow
of a huge shopping mall.  Restoration of the small shops and cafe's are
in progress, however there is still much work to be done.  Cafe's spill
out onto the sidewalk and there are clean, new windows displaying the
boutiques wares yet boarded up shops are still more numerous than the
new renovations. About midway along the street the bitumen gives way to
brick red and slate colored cobblestones that lead up to the shiny new
shopping mall and its large parking lot.

The Entrance to the Coleman Street Mall~
Here the brick red and slate colored cobblestones have been laid out in
large, symmetrical swirls centered around a small water feature.  A bright,
neon sign proclaims this place to be "Coleman Street Mall" in huge letters
over the sliding glass door entrance.  The building itself is a tan color
with bold green lines around the edges.  Potted palms, public phone booths
and benches line the side of the entrance, and though a good effort has been
made to keep this area clean from rubbish and street art these are still
tagged and only a few of the phones actually work.  There is also a large
backlit sign listing all the stores that are in the building.

Lincoln Avenue~
Busy Lincoln Ave roars with the traffic flying past.  The street itself
is relatively well-kept, but less can be said for the fairly industrial area
bordering it.  Many of the buildings are monoliths of the previous economic
high times when jobs were plentiful and life was good for most sectors of
the community.  The area has long since fallen into some serious disrepair.

buildings into some sort of nightclub.

Lincoln Ave~
The industrial section of Lincoln gives way to the startings of a more
downtown area here and on to the east.  The buildings at this point are
still industrial looking, but are beginning to look more like store houses
for small shops than small factories and real warehouses.

Lincoln Ave~
As Lincoln approaches Broadway to the east the atmosphere and
architechture changes, becoming less industrial as it is to the west and
more of a downtown area.  To look east and west is somewhat like comparing
night and day, although neither is particularly run down or abused.

The Corner of Lincoln Ave and Broadway~
Lincoln's busy lanes, which continue east and west, are intersected hereby another busy thoroughfare.  Broadway appears somewhat less than aptlynamed from here with its two relatively narrow, but busy, lanes.  It seemsas if some of the businesses from elsewhere have moved to make a fairly niceshopping district however.  ~

Coleman Street (East/West)~
Amidst the decrepit remains of the once prosperous district an oasis
rises, drawing its design on classical greek architecture.  One of the
old buildings from the turn of the century has been painstakingly
restored, with a small plaza opening leading up to the main structure
itself. Comparitively, the buildings on either side look as though they
are pending demolition which only serve to enhance the elegance of the
restored building.  The building is a reminder of what this area once
must have been like in its more prosperous times.

A Hidden Garden~
Sheltered under the wide blanket of the weeping willow rests a smallgarden.  There is a wrought iron bench near the trunk of the massive treewhere one may sit and view the peaceful arrangement.  The plants arearranged in strict adhearance to the style dictated by formal Japanesegardens.  Most of the plants are a wide variety from the moss family thatdisplay their lacy {Gg{gre{Gen{g foliage as they crawl over one of the fiverocks resting here.  Around the five rocks there are night flowering plantswith small, pale, moonkissed petals and round or heart-shaped leaves.  Offto one side a bonzai maple proudly displays its colorful leaves and artfullybound branches.  A small patch of sun will spotlight this piece of thegarden intermitantly through the day as someone has carefully trimmed thewillow's canopy to direct the light onto it and at night it will filter thesoft, moonlight in a similar fashion.  Whoever takes care of this secluded,secret garden has put much love and effort into its creation.  {x ~

Delany Avenue~
Delany Avenue is a filthy street where it's hard to find a wall thathasn't been tagged by someone or another.  Discarded fastfood wrappers andother garbage blows about with the wind or sits there, laughing at thegarbage men who hurry through the neighborhood.  The streets here look likethey haven't been repaved in years and it shows.  ~

Delany Avenue~
Delany Avenue is in one of the less affluent neighborhoods.  It's hard tofind people who live here but it's just as hard to find people who've movedout.  It's the kind of neighborhood where people never leave.  The streethas piles of garbage out on the curb and the streets themselves have seenfar better days, with numerous potholes dotting them.  ~

Delany Avenue~
Delany Avenue is one of those places where good people just don't go
often.  It's here that people scare their children with and to the north, is
one of those places.  It's an old tenement building and the looks like it
should be torn down.  Still, from the faint sounds, people appear to live
there.

Lincoln Studio Apartments on the First Floor~
Upon entering the apartment complex a sudden silence is so strong that it
can almost be felt.  A long line of PO Boxes fill the western wall, and a
pair of elevator doors stare back into the lobby with a blank expression
from the north.  The hallway continues east while the main exit is to the
south.  

<ooc> 'press button' to call the elevator, and 'enter elevator' to go
inside.
