<Syntax>reboot - Resets the mud, kicking everyone off and starting fresh.
warmboot - resets the mud while maintaing player logins.
~</Syntax>
<Desc>Sometimes it becomes necessary to restart the mud. Whether this event
comes at a time when new code is being added or just when something
bizarre starts happening in the data sequence. In any case, normally a
warmboot is sufficient to set things right, however on occasion a full
reboot is necessary and should happen on a regular basis to prevent the
gradual memory bleed which can occur if a new piece of code is not
compatible with existing memory management code.
A warmboot resets does not completely clear all memory, which is worth
periodically doing.  It also leaves the mud running in it's original
process space, which may not be advisable when messing with memory
types.

<Topic>MOB Levels~</Topic>
<Desc>For those of you who were wondering, mob levels are a bit dodgy.  The
level of a mob needs to be a multiple of 25 for it to function at the
moment.
Currently, the arrangement is, for an average, mortal-type mob, the
level should be set to 50. Weak mobs should be set to 25, and strong
mortal mobs should be at 75. Average supernatural mobs should be at 75,
weak at 50, and strong should be at 100 or in very strong cases 125.
Currently the system works like this:
Mob levels are divided by 25.  This number is then used to determine the
randomiser for the number of dots set in each skill and attribute, and
in the case of supernaturals, each power.  Ergo, currently if you set a
mob to have level 50 they have a chance to gain 3 in some things, but
are most likely to gain 2 or 1 in dot values at this stage as you can
imagine, but this being the case I'm going to have to bring forward some
things on here.

examination. Nothing is ever perfect, and the blemishes must be pointed
out in order for the good to be truly known. Your standards are high for
everything, and you insist on their being met. You encourage the same
ideals in others, because laxity and low standards reduce the quality of
life for everyone. Others will thank you later, once they discover the
purity of your perspective. You seek out and expose the imperfections in
every person or thing you encounter. You are never satisfied with
anything that is less than perfect, unless it is within yourself - after
all, you're not a perfectionist.

<Desc>What's the sense of working hard when you can get something for nothing?
Why drudge when, just by talking, you can get what you want? You always
try to find the easy way out, the fast track to success and wealth. Some
people might call what you do swindling or even outright theft, but you
know that you only do what everyone else does, you just do it better.
Additionally, it's a game, and you get great pleasure out of outwitting
someone. Connivers play many roles, so you may be a thief, a swindler, a
street waif, an entrepreneur, a con man or just a finagler.

<Desc>Finding people to roleplay with can be one of the more frustrating

Being available allows a person to be "joined" by others wishing to
engage in a roleplaying session. To find out who is available and what
they are looking for, you can type "who available" to find out who is
available online. Setting yourself as being in "rp mode" frees you from
the confines of ooc influences. In rpmode you cannot be attacked using
the combat system, cannot be fed from, and do not get hungry.

<Topic>Storytelling~</Topic>
<Desc>Project Twilight is a storytelling game in the style of White Wolf's
games.  The idea of a storytelling game is to weave an engrossing tale for
the entertainment of all involved.  

In a story, the storyteller sets the scene and operates the non-player
characters with whom the players' character can interact.  A story has
aspects similar to a dramatic production, however the script is improvised
by the actors following the guidelines of each character's personality. 
Thus characters can develop and move the plot along in a fluid and natural
way, rather than being bound by too much overhead.  In scenes, the
storyteller's ruling on an action is final, and his or her decisions must be
accepted and respected.  If you are uncomfortable with the given situation
or distressed by the action in the scene, please notify the storyteller
immediately so that the scene can be stopped and the difficulty
circumvented.  We do not want to cause any person to be made uncomfortable
by the progression of a story.

<Desc>As the parents a Garou was born of affect it's development and powers,
so too does the phase of the moon under which he was born. The phase of
the moon affects the temperament and path which Gaia has assigned to the
Garou. Although it is possible to change a werewolf's auspice, the
practice is looked down upon, and the newly reborn Garou must prove
their worth once more, losing all reknown and auspice powers in the
process.

Rage is what seperates a werewolf from human society and makes humans
shie away from them instinctively. Rage allows a Garou to move with
incredible speed, and gain supernatural strength, it is also what
allows the transformation to forms other than a Garou's birth form.

character is aiming to be.  This is why Project Twilight gives you the space
to select a NATURE, DEMEANOR and CONCEPT for your character.  It is also the

<Unformatted>Topic: Roleplaying - Playing a Character
Description:
Roleplaying is the art of adopting a new persona, of creating a
fictional character and responding to events as that character would,
rather than as you as a player would respond. This is a rather
confusing distinction sometimes, and it does generally require some
practice, but adapting to a roleplaying environment can be a very
rewarding experience.
In essence, roleplaying is a form of free-form improvised acting. The
character may be close in personality to the actor, but there must
always be a certain degree of separation maintained to allow the
character to live and grow as a separate entity. Good roleplaying
almost always sees a character grow and develop, taking on a life of
its own and becoming a very definable and recognisable creature.
Project Twilight is meant as a roleplaying environment. We are seeking
to create a world of living beings whose interactions with one another
and their world at large create engaging stories of near boundless
scopes. We hope that you will join us in making this dream a reality.
Closed emotes, ie. emotes which define an action as an absolute
success, are only really reasonable where they do not affect another
character or mob within the mud. It should also be noted that
blatantly abusing players will have IC repercussions and is not going
to endear you to anyone.

   A Clan in Vampire lore - often also called "Cainite" lore, as per the
descendants of Caine, the first vampire - refers to all the descendants
of a single being of the Third Generation with numerous enough progeny.
   In today's modern world, thirteen Clans are recognised as such; at
least two others have _stopped_ being such when their founder was destroyed
along with most of its members, and yet another seems to have shared that
fate - so conclusively that we do not even have a recorded name for it.
   To learn more about any one Clan, type "{ghelp [{GClan name{g]"; you will
be given a few details about its nature, weaknesses, and general theme.

<Desc>Capitalists, aristocrats, crusaders and criminals: The Ventrue have
assumed the prestigious but demanding role of leaders.  Forever in the
line of fire, they have sacrificed their own comfort for the good of all
Kindred.  Or is this all a facade that hides their excesses and greed?
The Kindred of Clan Ventrue have a reputation for being honorable,
genteel and of impeccable taste.  From time out of mind, Ventrue has
been the clan of leadership, enforcing the ancient traditions and
seeking to shape the destiny of the Kindred.  In nights of old, Ventrue
were chosen from nobles, merchant princes or other wielders of power.
In modern times the clan recruits from wealthy "old money" families,
ruthless corporate climbers, and politicians.  Whatever their origin,
Ventrue vampires preserve stability and maintain order for the
Camarilla.  Other Kindred often mistake this for arrogance or avarice,
but to the Ventrue, their shepherd's role is more burden than honor.

<Desc>From her first night among the Kindred, the neonate Tremere leads a
double unlife.  Bound not only by the traditions of the Camarilla but by
those of her clan, the Tremere must find a place for herself in her own
hierarchy and in the deadly world of vampires.  Learn the magic of the
Tremere and the rigors of earning status in the clan.  Whether dreaded,
mistrusted, feared or reviled, the insular vampires of Clan Tremere are
anything but ignored.  Those who have heard of the clan's doings are
typically suspicious of the Tremere, and with good reason - for the
Warlocks are aptly named.
Through their own artifice, they have mastered a form of vampiric
sorcery, complete with rituals and spells, that is as potent - if not
more so - than any other power of the Blood. Paired with the clan's
rigid hierarchy and the smoldering ambition so common among Warlocks,
this power is an unsettling thing indeed to those who know what the
Tremere are capable of doing.

Knowledges.  The three groupings represent the kind of ability which falls
into the relevant category.  Abilities are not commands in themselves, but
descriptive values for how good a person is at performing related actions. 


Talents contain those abilities which are extensions of personality traits. 
Example: leadership, empathy, and brawl.  

Skills represent abilities which produce more tangible or physical results. 
Example: drive, repair, and survival.  Knowledges require greater studies
and generally have less tangible bases.  Example: law, science and occult.

<Unformatted>Topic:  ROM
Description: ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In 
July of 1993, ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM. 
ROM was up for a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) 
was released, and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers 
of Mud under a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.
Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code.  It will 
be found at hypercube.org 6666, when it is opened.
The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:
Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen
New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen
Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth
Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)
Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)
Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)
Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander
Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world
Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug 
    reports and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches
New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the 
originator of the ASCII flags used in the zone files
ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release 
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code 
was written by Seth Scott (enchant armor, the new poofin/poofout), and 
many contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of 
Rusty's code from Moosehead also remain.
The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with 
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't 
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and 
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.
Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the 
changes to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late 
night of hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.
(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

<Unformatted>Topic:  Reset Commands
Syntax:  [see below]
Description:
  RESET [number] OBJ [vnum] [location on body] - equips last mobile
  RESET [number] OBJ [vnum] inside [obj vnum] [limit] [count]- store in container
  RESET [number] OBJ [vnum] room - store in room
  RESET [number] MOB [vnum] [area max] [room max] - load a mobile
  RESET [number] DELETE - delete a reset
RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The [number] 
will be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible 
locations that an object can be loaded to.  The [[max #]] is the maximum 
number of mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no 
number is entered.
For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical 
order.  For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container 
in the room and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the 
mobile.  It is likely that resets will backfire if they are not 
carefully entered.
If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

<Unformatted>{MTopic:  Mental Attributes
 
{MDescription:
The three mental attributes relate to the intellectual capabilities of
the character. The character's ability for rational thought,
perceptiveness, and ability to think on their feet are all summed up by
these attributes.
 
{gPerception: To see, to hear, to smell, touch and taste, these are the
ways we experience our world. For characters, these senses and their
relativity acuity are summed up in the perception attribute. The
character's ability to notice and recognise influences and details in
their environment are also examples in which perception will come into
play.
 
{gIntelligence: The capacity for rational and lateral thinking are summed
up in the character's intelligence attribute. Anything which makes use
of the character's ability to think, plan, design or consider a course
of action and weigh its merit which does not require a reflexive
response is where the character must rely upon their intelligence score.
 
{gWits: Where intelligence is required for considered action, quick
responses and split second decisions are functions of the character's
wits attribute. Characters with high wits are quick on their feet and
good in tight situations.

<Topic>Vampire Clan: Malkavian~</Topic>
<Desc>The childer of Malkav bear two curses: undeath and madness.  From
emotionless sociopaths to raving lunatics and everything in between, the
Malkavians nonetheless command startling insight.  Does what they know
drive them to madness or does their insanity allow them too peer into a
world the rest of us fear to see?  Even other Damned fear the
Malkavians.
The cursed blood of their clan has polluted their minds, with the result
that every last Malkavian across the world is incurably insane.  What's
worse, a Malkavian's madness can take nearly any form, from overpowering
homicidal tendencies to near-catatonia.  In many cases, there's no way
to tell a Malkavian apart from the "sane" members of other clans.  Those
few whose psychoses are immediately obvious are among the most
terrifying vampires to stalk the streets.

Essentally all three commands serve the same purpose, to turn

a little simplistic, but each character which begins as a human
must go through a transformation to become something more.
 
{gembrace allows a vampire to kill a mortal character and "resurrect" them
as kindres. Any vampire may create another, however the power of each
successive genteration is lowered. It should also be noted that the childe,
as the new kidred is called, is the responsibility of it's creator as far
as vampiric society is concerned.
 
{gchrysalis allows a changling (faerie) to awaken a faerie soul within the
human, thus breathing a new life of enchantment into the newly awakened faerie.

The players will operate characters, produced in much the same way White
Wolf(TM)'s World Of Darkness(TM) games' (Vampire: the Masquerade,
Werewolf: the Apocalypse, Changeling: the Dreaming, etc. - all
Trademarks of White Wolf Game Studio) characters are made. All game
mechanics will be fairly closely based upon those of the World of
Darkness(TM) games.

The Storytellers will produce plots which will be played out by an
artificial intelligence engine specifically designed to cope with the
demands of multiple plots and a sizable number of autonomous
personalities, as designed and released by the standard code and the
additions supplied by the storytellers.

Hopefully, when the final release is available, we will have an
enjoyable roleplaying experience unlike any to be found elsewhere in
muds.

<Topic>Builder: Introduction~</Topic>
<Desc>This is not meant to be an end-all, be-all for new builders.  Instead,
this help is meant to provide some guidelines for building areas, rooms,
mobs and objects.  I intend to start with the help on Rooms first, since
that is what _EVERYONE_ looks at.  Let us begin.
Rooms are made up of two important parts: The name of the room and the
description.  The name of the room should be formatted so that it reads
like a book title.  All the words should be capped unless it is a word
like "the, a, an, etc..." unless it is the first room like: "The Storage
Shed" or "The Library".
Descriptions on the other hands should be _AT LEAST_ three sentences
long and no sense should be forgotten.  Players rely on the description
to tell them what is going on in the room.  Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste
and Touch are all important.  Most people rely too heavily on Sight, but
what about the other senses.  What does the room smell like, does it
have strange accoustics?  Most people do not understand how a room
tastes, but everyone know's what smoke tastes like.  Last, there is
touch. Are the walls textured?  Use your imagination.
Furthermore, if at all possible please avoid the use of the word "you"
in room descriptions. It detracts from the whole effect.

<Topic>Vampire Clan: Assamite~</Topic>
<Desc>Desert warriors, arab assassins, shadows in the dark, diablerists, much
is told of the Assamites by outsiders - and some of it might even be
true. Based in and coming from a supposedly secret stronghold somewhere
in the East for ages untold, united to some purpose under the banner of
their founder to whom they seem to refer to in the greatest respect,
these Cainites are keeping to themselves and holding onto a strange,
tenuous neutrality and code of beliefs.

There seem to be castes within the Clan, of whom only one - the
Warriors, internally referred to as Judges, for some reason  - was until
now prominent; but which the other castes in or what their functions, it
is unknown to all but the Children themselves.

<Topic>Influence: Church~</Topic>
<Desc>Though the modern church has arguable less control over temporal
society than it did in the Middle Ages, its policies still exert
considerable influence over the direction of politics and communities.
Knowing the appropriate people allows insight into many mainstream
religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Shinto or
Buddhism (fringe or alternative groups, such as Scientology, are
considered Occult).  When you exercise Church Influence, you can change
religious policy, affect the assignment of the clergy and access a
variety of lore and resources.
   Contacts and allies affected by Church Influence would include
ministers, priests, bishops, Church-sponsored witch-hunters, holy orders
and various attendees and assistants.
   The Church is one of the most ancient bulwarks of Kindred Influence -
and the most dangerous.  In the World of Darkness, the Church still
keeps the truth about the supernatural locked away in its oldest
libraries.
   Kindred with high levels of Church Influence dare to use this power
to their own ends.  Most Kindred possessing level of Influence this high
can still remember the foundations of some of these faiths.

<Topic>Economic Influence~</Topic>
<Desc>Manipulating markets, stock reports and investments is a hobby of
many Cainites, especially those who use their knowledge to keep hidden
wealth.
   Though your actual available money is a function of your Resources,
you can use Finance Influence to start or smother businesses, crush or
support banking institutions and alter credit records.
   Clearly, such power over money is not to be trifled with - fortunes
are made and destroyed with this sort of pull.  CEOs, bankers,
stockbrokers, bank tellers, yes-men, financiers and loan agents are
found among such work.
  The higher levels of Finance become a dizzying game for Kindred.  The
Cainite elders who were merchant princes during the Renaissance are in
awe of the stock market, let alone the pace of electronic money
transfers.  In this day and age, it takes very energetic Kindred to stay
on top of the financial world.  Many elders delegate this power to
younger Kindred.  As a consequence, this is one area where ancillae can
truly taste power. Elders, confident of their leash upon these upstarts,
allow their childer to play - as long as they get the results they
desire.

<Desc>Directing media attention away from vampire activities is a key
component of the Masquerade.  Putting specific emphasis on certain
events can place an enemy in an uncomfortable spotlight or discredit a
rival.
With Media, you can crush or alter news stories, control the operations
of news stations and reporters and sway public opinion, with DJs,
editors of all varieties, reporters, cameramen, photographers and
broadcasters at your disposal.

<Topic>Judicial Influence~</Topic>
<Desc>Since many of the operations that Cainites undertake are at least
marginally illegal, a good amount of sway over judges and lawyers is
indispensable.  Those Kindred who dabble in law often pull strings in
the courts to make sure that the questionable practices of Cainite
society go unnoticed and unpunished.

Of course, a little Legal Influence is also excellent for harassing an
enemy's assets, too.  Such Influence ranges from law schools and firms,
to lawyers, judges, DAs, clerks and public defenders.

The truly dedicated are not interested in just manipulating the law;
they want to shape it to fit their own desires.  Perhaps the heavy
influence of Kindred upon the law is the reason most lawyers have such
poor reputations.  Then again, perhaps not.  Like does attract like,
after all.

<Topic>Police Influence~</Topic>
<Desc>"To protect and serve" is the motto of the police, but these days,
Kindred and kine alike may have cause to wonder who is being protected
and served. That said, Police Influence can be very handy to assist with
the Masquerade, to protect one's holdings or to raid the assets of
another.

After all, attitude won't save the anarchs whose haven is the target of
a daylight raid.  Police of all ranks, detectives, clerical staff,
dispatchers, prison guards, special divisions (such as SWAT or homicide)
and local highway patrol make up these ranks.

<Topic>Influence: Political~</Topic>
<Desc>Deal-making is second nature to most vampires, so they can get along
very well with other bloodsuckers - that is, politicians.  Altering
party platforms, controlling local elections, changing appointed offices
and calling in favors all falls under the purview of Political
Influence.
   Well-timed blackmail, bribery, spin doctoring or any sundry tricks
are stock in trade on both sides of this fence.  Some of the likely
contacts and allies include pollsters, lobbyists, activists, party
members, spin doctors and politician from rural zoning committees to the
mayors of major cities or Congressional representatives.
   This is another high-profile Influence that many Kindred tend to
avoid at the upper levels.  Although younger ancillae recognize the
dizzying heights of power that such influence can bring, most Kindred
prefer to work behind the scenes, appointing the leaders of men rather
than serving the common good themselves.

<Topic>Influence: Criminal~</Topic>
<Desc>The world of crime offers lucrative possibilities to strong-willed
or subtle leaders.  Guns, money, drugs and vice - such delicious pastimes
can be led by anyone talented or simply vicious enough to take them.
   Underworld Influence lets you call on such favors for all manner of
illegal dealings, and its ranks are filled by the Mafia, La Cosa Nostra,
drug dealers, bookies, Yakuza, tongs, hitmen, fences and criminal gangs.
   The inception of the Mafia dates back to the Renaissance, and it's
entirely likely that a Kindred thought of the idea first.  Several clans
of Kindred have sparred over control of the Mafia for centuries, fueling
an already-volatile mix.
   The potential for violence, blood and easy answers to hard problems
brings a never-ending stream of new investors in this ancient profession.
The Camarilla has a solid foothold in the upper reaches of this Influence,
but that could change at any moment.  In particular, the arrival of the
Eastern vampires threatens the small grasp some Kindred have over the
tongs and triads in the various Chinatowns.

<Topic>Vampire Clan: Lasombra~</Topic>
<Desc>Clan Lasombra is the one leading one of the Jyhad's two major sects, the
Sabbat, and with good reason; manipulative and efficient, sometimes
ruthless and always long-term planners and leaders of kine and Cainite
alike, these masters of shadows have dwelled in darkness for ages
untold, spinning their weaves and plans in the pursuit of power.

Their major strength coming not from the ability to physically bend
shadowy tendrils to their will and using it as its extensions to crush
their enemies but from their ability to blend in and take charge, Clan
Lasombra has been influencing the Christian Church for well over a
millenium, in the Dark Ages manipulating it to gain awesome political
influence over entire nations; even today, many of its members claim a
priest's robe, or are somehow tied to a monastery or similar sanctuary
of a divine nature.

to their face - are along with the Lasombra members of the Sabbat,
counterbalancing the Camarilla for world influence in the eternal game
of the Jyhad.

Founded and still basing their main strength in central Europe, this
Clan possesses (or, some would have it, has been possessed itself
by) a powerful Discipline that allows them to shape the flesh, bones and
physique of Cainite and mortal alike, allowing them to create powerful,
potent and oftentimes bizarre and freakish creatures; thinking that just
as a mortal resembles a first stage of evolution out of which he or she
may become a Cainite, thus the vampiric form may itself be but a stage
for - something - else to spring; the entire Clan seems to be intent on
discovering that something.

<Topic>Vampire Clan: Giovanni~</Topic>
<Desc>The Giovanni Clan have been an oddity even among the Kindred from the
very beginning; their roots during the Dark Ages, when the Cappadocians
Embraced a small number of Italian merchants who then began - or had
already started even before then - to specialize in contacting the dead
for their own purposes. Quicky rising into power, that family launched a
major offensive against exactly those who brought them immortality,
eventually all but wiping out the entire Clan from existance.
Since then, the Giovanni have become a true financial power with their
undying fingers in every aspect of international crime, porn industry,
and drug trafic, as well as exercising and perfecting Necromancy over
the long centuries. Rumours have long since raged about the Clan's
internal ties, since they seem to be a single _family_, including ghouls
and still mortal servants - ties strong enough to often cross into
incest, it is said.
Today one of the Kindred's major forces in the financial and political
world, the Giovanni maintain a strict air of very careful neutrality,
offering services - mainly in the field of transportation - to all other
Kindred, always for a high fee or boon, with their base and throne of
power in central and northern Italy.

<Desc>Obtenebration is the trademark Discipline of clan Lasombra which grants

The unnatural darkness summoned by Obtenebration is extremely
frightening to mortals, animals, and even other Cainites unaccustomed to
its use. The exact nature of this Discipline is unknown even among its
greatest masters, and it has been a subject of religious, philosophical,
and metaphysical debate among vampires for millennia. Its greateat
scholars are the followers of the Path of Night and practitioners of
Abyss Mysticism, which draws on knowledge of this Discipline in its
rituals. While fairly common within the Sabbat, Obtenebration is
virtually nonexistant among Camarilla vampires and anyone seen using it
would be regarded with extreme suspicion.
Powers contained in this Discipline are: Shadow Play, Shroud of Night,
Arms of the Abyss, Black Metamorphosis, Shadow Form

<Desc>The only Clan to have closer ties to the Gypsies of the world than the Gangrel are those of Clan Ravnos.  They are known as tricksters, who have mastered a Discipline concerning itself solely with illusion. Despite their reputation as irreverant mountebanks and jesters, the Clan is feared by some more than even the dreaded Setites or Tzimisce.  These masters of illusion, primarily of Indian and Gypsy stock, owe allegiance to  themselves first, their clan second, and to no one else at all.
Certainly the most loosely organized of the unaligned clans, the nomadic Ravnos are scattered across the world. It is well known that, should a Ravnos be publically derided or punished by the rulers of any city, members of Clan Ravnos from all over the region will arrive in force to play as many practical jokes on the offending rulers (and anyone else who gets in the way) as possible, often leaving them completely bereft of anything of value (should the game not get darker and they lose their unlives to a sinister prank).

predators on mankind for ages untold, and mages harnessing vast, potent
powers that bend reality to their will; wild creatures roam the country
sides.  And for humans, the world is a darker, more dangerous place - the

<Unformatted>Topic: Emote Fighting
 
Description:
 
Emote fighting is a player skill, and one which should be encouraged and
developed. It involves both careful scripting of movements to allow for
shifting weight or position and recognising that the combat is an
interactive one, and not railroading the conflict through use of
closed emotes.
 
Keep in mind that the use of closed emotes on other creatures is a fairly
serious faux pas and will create instant antagonism.
 
For more information on emote fighting, it's history and some examples
from which to learn, please check out:

<Topic>OLC: Mob Levels~</Topic>
<Desc>For those of you who were wondering, mob levels are a bit dodgy.  The
level of a mob needs to be a multiple of 25 for it to function at the
moment. Currently, the arrangement is, for an average, mortal-type mob,
the level should be set to 50. Weak mobs should be set to 25, and strong
mortal mobs should be at 75. Average supernatural mobs should be at 75,
weak at 50, and strong should be at 100 or in very strong cases 125.
Currently the system works like this:
Mob levels are divided by 25.  This number is then used to determine the
randomiser for the number of dots set in each skill and attribute, and
in the case of supernaturals, each power.  Ergo, currently if you set a
mob to have level 50 they have a chance to gain 3 in some things, but
are most likely to gain 2 or 1 in dot values.

<Topic>Status, Rank, Fame~</Topic>
<Desc>There are a number of types of status in Project Twilight, not all of
which have real meaning at this stage. At the same time these ideas may
be very important to some others, and often have serious implications.
Race status (also known as Rank to the werewolf population) carries a
number of meanings. For vampires this describes where a character lands
in the social pecking order, for werewolves it also increases the power
of gifts which they can learn.
Organisation status has no meaning yet, but once player created
organisations are worthwhile creating, there will be options for
improving org status and meanings associated with it dependant on what
your particular group associates it with.
Clan status recognises your position in the clan, tribe or kith. And
finally, fame is the character's recognition level in mortal society.

<Topic>Builder: VNUM~</Topic>
<Desc>Vnum is the abbreviation for virtual number, a reference tag for items
in the mud's area databases. Rooms, objects and mobiles all have vnums
which are unique to the particular typeof room/object/mob.
For example, a mob and a room can have the same vnum, but two mobs
cannot.
Individual resets can be of the same mob or object vnum, however the
actual mob or object configurations cannot contain duplicate vnums.
Hence we can have multiple joggers created from the same mob vnum, but
we cannot have multiple mob types with the same vnum.
Hopefully this is less confusing than I think I've made it.

<Topic>Neonates, Anarchs and Autarks~</Topic>
<Desc>Neonate refers to a vampire who has been accepted and recognised by a
Prince, and thereby given a modicum of status in the city. As one of the
methods by which a new kindred can be allowed a continued existence,
this is a regular practice within the Camarilla and is also a necessary
social move for newcomers to a city.
Unless you've been recruited by the Sabbat, the other option available
to young kindred is to join the ranks of the anarchs. The anarch
movement is mostly made up of young vampires, but does count some elders
amongst their number. Refusing to belong to either institution of
kindred, the anarchs are largely disorganised and amorphous, existing on
the fringes of cities held by the Sabbat or Camarilla or forming their
own "Baronies" such as existed in the Anarch Free States along the west
coast of the USA.
A special class of unconnected kindred bears mention, the Autarks.
Autarks are the original anarchs, those who refused to comply with even
their own clans before there was an anarch movement. Autarks tend to be
older, reclusive vampires who often live somewhat hermitic lifestyles.
Generally, it is wise for younger kindred to avoid autarks on the off
chance that they take offense at the intrusion.

{MDescription:
By now, if you've set your description, written a note, or done any one
of a number of other things writing strings, you've probably had to face
the string editor. It really isn't as bad as it looks, you just have to
get used to it.
 
Remember, if you get stuck, typing ".c" on a new line clears the string,
".h" displays the commands, and the "@" symbol will junk you out.

<Desc>While a Prince rules a city, he must still be accepted and supported by
the council of elders of the city known as the primogen. While, as with
the majority of kindred society, these leaders may themselves be pawns
of other powers, the primogen do hold a great deal of sway. The primogen
as a body have been known to depose Princes and call for insurrection in
the populace, and their support is normally required for a Prince to
succeed in making their will law.
The Primogen should be considered authorities in their own right as much
as they are when united, and normally hold a great deal of influence
within their clans at least within their city.

<Desc>Chimerstry is a Discipline that gives the vampire the ability to create sense based illusions. This Discipline is inherent in the Ravnos clan and is said to have been discovered by the clan's founder. The abilities of Chimerstry are used not only against opponents but for amusement of other clan members. Vampires who possess this discipline keep its secrets closely guarded and rarely admit to using on anyone, including their own in some cases. 
 
When using the higher levels of Chimerstry, the opponent is often given the chance to see if they are taken in by the illusion. The extrasensory Auspex Discipline can also contribute to a character's resisstance.
Powers include:

<Desc>SOCEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.
SOCEDIT DELETE [social] deletes that social. The deletion is
irrecoverable, save for restoring a backup file, so use this command
with great care!
SOCEDIT NEW [social] creates a new, empty social. SOCEDIT SHOW [social]
shows all of the strings for that social.
SOCEDIT [string-name] [social] [string] changes a certain of the 7
strings that make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message
will be sent to the involved characters.
There are 7 strings that make up a social:
cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and
sees:
Hug whom?
onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the
case of HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player
types HUG by itself.
cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:
You hug Y.
vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:
X hugs you.
ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyone but X and Y see:
X hugs Y.
cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X
types HUG X :
You hug yourself.
oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:
X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.
To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:
$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.
 
For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex, etc.
 
So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you would
do the following:
